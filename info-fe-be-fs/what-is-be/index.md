[Back to What is Front End Development?](../what-is-fe)

In a broad sense, Back End engineering is concerned with managing and manipulating ​data​ (aka information).

Consider a website like VCA Hospitals. When we view the landing page, what are the parts we actually care about? Why did we come here in the first place? In the screenshot below, the light blue box outlines the opportunity for the user to get **dynamic data** that will have to come from _somewhere_. That _somewhere_ is what Back End engineering is concerned with.

When we talk about Back End engineering, we're often thinking of the programming tasks involved in making this possible:

- Storing data and accessing it later
- Verifying that data is accurate
- Manipulating, analyzing, and/or calculating data
- Making sure data can be retrieved quickly and easily


## What technologies are used on the Back End?

There are numerous technologies that can be used for Back End programming. Here are a few of them:

- **Languages and frameworks**: Ruby/Rails, Python/Django, Elixir/Phoenix, Java/Spring, and more.
- **Databases**: PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle Database, MongoDB, etc.
