## Welcome!

We are so glad you are here! To get set up...

2. Heads up! We will ask you to briefly introduce yourself in a minute.

## Goals

The goal of this session is to give you a general understanding of different areas of software development by...
- exploring frontend, backend, and full stack software development
- explaining what we teach at Turing and why
- answering questions you have or get you connected with someone who can answer your questions
