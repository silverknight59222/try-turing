# What is Full Stack Software Development?

## Revisiting How the Web Works
!["Simple client server model, client/computer is on left side , with an arrow labeled 'request' pointing to a server on the right right. The server has an arrow labeled 'response' pointing back to the client. The set of arrows is labeled with 'HTTP(S)'."](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Forms/Sending_and_retrieving_form_data/client-server.png)

As you might imagine from the illustration above of how the web works, a Full Stack Developer will work across the whole "stack", working on both Front End and Back End technologies, handling both user interactions as well as data storage. 

A Full Stack Developer might work on creating the user interface for their company one day, and the next, figure out how to store the data the user inputs.

What do you think are some pros and cons to working as a Full Stack Developer?

## Pros and Cons

*Pros*
- You know whatâ€™s happening in all areas of the application/program.  
- You get exposure to a lot of things! (FE and BE)

*Cons*
- A lot of context switching (between languages, tools, and conversations)
- Harder to get really good at one thing (generalist vs specialist)
