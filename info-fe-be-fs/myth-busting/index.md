There are a lot of myths out there about Front End and Back End Development.
We want to bust those myths for you!

## Quiz Time

I'm going to read off one of the following myths. 
Using your zoom emojis, let us know if you think this is **MYTH** or **TRUTH**.

<div class="expander expander-lesson">
  <header>
    <h2 class="spicy-click">Front End Developers need to be good at design.</h2>
    <div>
      <button class="expander-btn">

        As we will see in a few minutes, once you understand the concepts and foundations of software development, you can apply that knowledge to any new language or framework you encounter.
