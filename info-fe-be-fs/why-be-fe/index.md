# What We Teach at Turing and Why

## At Turing, we teach two separate programs: Front End and Back End Development

Essentially, coding is coding, software development is software development whether you’re working Front End or Back End or both. Here at Turing, you will learn the fundamentals of programming and the concepts to be a good software developer. We use a backend language (Ruby) or a frontend language (JavaScript) to facilitate learning these concepts. 

We teach Front End or Back End separately so we can dive deep into this content and allow you to have a deep, solid understanding of software development.

Once you’ve got a good grasp on these fundamentals, you’ll be able to translate that information to any language or framework in the future, setting you up for success no matter what end of the stack or what language you end up working in. 

## The Realm of Software Development is Massive

Software is growing in complexity and is too vast for one person to know everything. Choosing a specialty allows you to be really good at one side of the stack and to grow deep knowledge and understanding. 

If we tried to teach a Full Stack program in 7 months, we would only be able to give you a surface level overview of all the technologies and what they do. We wouldn’t be able to dive deep into the foundational knowledge and concepts that would allow you to transfer these skills to any language.

However, specializing in Front End or Back End, does not mean you have to work that side of the stack for the rest of your life. We have many Back End students who end up getting jobs as Full Stack or Front End engineers and Front End students who get jobs as Full Stack or Back End devs. Because we do a deep dive of the fundamentals, it means you can apply those concepts to any language moving forward. 

*******Note:******* Our Back End students do learn about the Front End and build applications with user interaction and our Front End students do learn about storing data on the server. No matter which program you choose, you will learn about the Full Stack, but you will dive deep into one side.

## Sample Projects

At Turing, we teach through projects. In Mods 1 - 3, you will complete 3 - 4 projects each Mod, allowing you to experience real software development.

Check out some projects that our Front End and Back End students have built!

## Which Program Should I Choose? 

Ultimately, it does not matter. 

Here is a list of job titles some of our alumni have gotten:

- Full Stack Developer
- Software Engineer
- Associate Software Engineer
- Junior Backend Developer
- Data Analyst
- Developer
- Software Developer
- Quality Engineer
- Front-End Developer

Our students are prepared to enter the field of software development, period. If you can understand the concepts and the fundamentals and ***how*** everything is working, then you can pick up other languages and frameworks. They all essentially work the same, the syntax, or ***how*** the languages are written is just different. 

You should pick the program that you think will bring you the most joy. Both programs are challenging. Both involve a lot of logic. So, would you rather spend more time focusing on creating the User Interface? Or would you rather focus on how data is stored and manipulated in a database?
