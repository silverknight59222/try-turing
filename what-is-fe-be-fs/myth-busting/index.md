# Myth Busting

There are a lot of myths out there about Front End and Back End Development.
We want to bust those myths for you!

## Quiz Time

**Front End Developers need to be good at design.**
<div class="expander expander-lesson">
  <header>
    <h2 class="spicy-click">Answer</h2>
    <div>
      <button class="expander-btn">
        <img src="../../assets/icons/arrow.svg" alt="expander arrow icon" />
      </button>
    </div>
  </header>

  <div class="hide">
    <p>False!</p>
    <p>Often a company will have a UX/UI Designer who creates the designs, color schemes, and layouts. The Front End Developer will then 
    implement those designs using CSS or other styling tools and frameworks.</p>
  </div>
</div>


**Back End Developers need to be good at math.**
<div class="expander expander-lesson">
  <header>
    <h2 class="spicy-click">Answer</h2>
    <div>
      <button class="expander-btn">
        <img src="../../assets/icons/arrow.svg" alt="expander arrow icon" />
      </button>
    </div>
  </header>

  <div class="hide">
    <p>False!</p>
    <p>Most algorithms are concerned with basic math concepts like finding *sums* and *averages*. Any other mathematical formulas needed 
    can be googled!</p>
  </div>
</div>


**Front End is more creative than Back End.**
<div class="expander expander-lesson">
  <header>
    <h2 class="spicy-click">Answer</h2>
    <div>
      <button class="expander-btn">
        <img src="../../assets/icons/arrow.svg" alt="expander arrow icon" />
      </button>
    </div>
  </header>

  <div class="hide">
    <p>False!</p>
    <p> Both Front End and Back End allow for creativity. Front End is more visual and Back End is more code design, but the mere process of building software is quite creative!</p>
  </div>
</div>


**Back End is more difficult than Front End.**
<div class="expander expander-lesson">
  <header>
    <h2 class="spicy-click">Answer</h2>
    <div>
      <button class="expander-btn">
        <img src="../../assets/icons/arrow.svg" alt="expander arrow icon" />
      </button>
    </div>
  </header>

  <div class="hide">
    <p>False!</p>
    <p>Both Front End and Back End have their challenges. Either end of the stack will allow you to flex those brain muscles!</p>
  </div>
</div>

**Front End is mostly CSS and design.**
<div class="expander expander-lesson">
  <header>
    <h2 class="spicy-click">Answer</h2>
    <div>
      <button class="expander-btn">
        <img src="../../assets/icons/arrow.svg" alt="expander arrow icon" />
      </button>
    </div>
  </header>

  <div class="hide">
    <p>False!</p>
    <p>We polled our alumni working as Front End Engineers and asked them what percentage of their time is spent in CSS. The average was 
    only 10% of their time spent in CSS.</p>
  </div>
</div>


**Back End has way more logic than the Front End.**
<div class="expander expander-lesson">
  <header>
    <h2 class="spicy-click">Answer</h2>
    <div>
      <button class="expander-btn">
        <img src="../../assets/icons/arrow.svg" alt="expander arrow icon" />
      </button>
    </div>
  </header>

  <div class="hide">
    <p>False!</p>
    <p>Both Front End and Back End developers build algorithms that are logic heavy. How the Front End will take data, filter through it, 
   display it, takes a lot of logic to do so in an efficient way. Both Back End and Front End require heavy logic.</p>
  </div>
</div>

**Back End Developers can work in the Front End and Front End Developers can work in the Back End.**
<div class="expander expander-lesson">
  <header>
    <h2 class="spicy-click">Answer</h2>
    <div>
      <button class="expander-btn">
        <img src="../../assets/icons/arrow.svg" alt="expander arrow icon" />
      </button>
    </div>
  </header>

  <div class="hide">
    <p>True!</p>
    <p>As we will see in a few minutes, once you understand the concepts and foundations of software development, you can apply that knowledge to any new language or framework you encounter. At the end of the day, software development is software development, whether you're working in the Front End or the Back End.</p>
