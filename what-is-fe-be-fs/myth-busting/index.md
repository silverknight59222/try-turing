# Myth Busting

There are a lot of myths out there about Front End and Back End Development.
We want to bust those myths for you!

## Quiz Time

I'm going to read off one of the following myths. 
Using your zoom emojis, let us know if you think this is **MYTH** or **TRUTH**.

1. Front End Developers need to be good at design.
2. Back End Developers need to be good at math.
3. Front End is more creative than Back End.
4. Back End is more difficult than Front End.
5. Front End is mostly CSS and design.
6. Back End has way more logic than the Front End.
7. Back End Developers can work in the Front End and Front End Developers can work in the Back End.

***Answers***
No peeking! ðŸ˜œ

1. False! 
    Often a company will have a UX/UI Designer who creates the designs, color schemes, and layouts. The Front End Developer will then implement those designs using CSS or other styling tools and frameworks.
2. False!
    Most algorithms are concerned with basic math concepts like finding *sums* and *averages*. Any other mathematical formulas needed can be googled!
3. False!
   Both Front End and Back End allow for creativity. Front End is more visual and Back End is more code design, but the mere process of building software is quite creative!
4. False!
    Both Front End and Back End have their challenges. Either end of the stack will allow you to flex those brain muscles!
5. False!
    We polled our alumni working as Front End Engineers and asked them what percentage of their time is spent in CSS. The average was 10% 
    of their time is spent in CSS.
6. False!
   Both Front End and Back End developers build algorithms that are logic heavy. How the Front End will take data, filter through it, 
   display it, takes a lot of logic to do so in an efficient way. Both Back End and Front End require heavy logic.
7. True!
    As we will see in a few minutes, once you understand the concepts and foundations of software development, you can apply that knowledge to any new language or framework you encounter. At the end of the day, software development is software development, whether you're working in the Front End or the Back End.
