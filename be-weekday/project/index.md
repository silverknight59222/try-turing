# Final Project

<a href="../">Back to Curriculum Index</a>

<div class="try-it-new">
  <h2>Your Challenge</h2>
  <p>Write a Ruby program that asks a user several questions, or the same question several times. Collect each response they provide in an array.</p>
  <p>After the user has answered all the questions, print out a sentence to report back to the user what their answers were!</p>
  <p>If you're feeling creative, you could ask your user for words (various parts of speech even) and write a MadLib. If you're not feeling super creative, you could use one of these ideas: ask the user what they have in their fridge, or what their favorite songs are, or the names of each of their friends.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Alphabetize the array before you print out the final sentence to your user. <a target="blank" href="https://www.rubyguides.com/2017/07/ruby-sort/">This resource can help you get started!</a></li>
        <li>Modify your program to ask two sets of questions; maybe something like "What is the name of a friend?" and "What is the age of that friend?". Organize the data in two arrays. Print out a sentence that accurately groups the names and ages!</li>
        <li>If you are really feeling confident and want to push the envelope, <a href="../extensions">click on the the Extensions section</a>, read to teach yourself about iteration, and work to implement that into your current project.</li>
