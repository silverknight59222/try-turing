- Change Zoom display name to first name, last initial, pronouns; _ie - Amy H. (she/her)_

## What to Expect

Over the course of the day, we will write code, explore the mindsets that successful developers have, and learn a little more about Turing.  We will ask you to introduce yourself, ask questions, and occasionally share out answers to the technical work we do! Below is our agenda for the day (all times in MST):

- **1:00 - 3:40** Welcome, Intros, and Instruction
- **3:40 - 4:20** Turing Info
- **4:20 - 4:55** Alumni Panel
- **4:55 - 5:00**  Wrap Up, Questions

## Learning Norms

- No question is too small. No question is a bad question. Ask them!
- We all benefit from each others ideas! Push yourself to share out and make sure you aren't sharing _so_ much that others don't have the space to do so
- Please mute your microphone **unless** you're the main speaker
- Have your camera on during class if possible!
- Questions? Type into the group chat box or wait until end of section when we open it up for questions
