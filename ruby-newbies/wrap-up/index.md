# Wrap Up

In a short workshop we have worked through a LOT of content! Remember, the goal wasn't to become an expert, so you shouldn't actually feel like one. You should have a sense of if you like coding and thinking like a programmer, and have some questions bubbling up about what else is possible and how it might be acheived!

<strong>Please share about your experience, and how we can best support you moving forward, by completing <a target="blank" href="https://forms.gle/UuK9XBgMKFWxKGu77">this survey</a>.</strong>
