Of all of the major technologies used on the web—on either the front- or the back-end—HTML is the oldest. In the beginning, the web was just a bunch of HTML documents that you wrote by hand. They had these cool things called hyperlinks that would allow to click on a word on one page and be taken to another page.

At the end of the day, HTML is made up two things: text and tags that mark up that text.

Let's say that we had some text and we wanted to denote that this text was a paragraph.

```
This text is a paragraph.
```

We'd wrap the text in paragraph tags.

```html
<p>This text is a paragraph.</p>
```

We use `<p>` to signal to the browser that everything that's about to follow is part of a paragraph and `</p>` to let the browser know that this paragraph is done. When a user visits our application, the browser loads up the HTML and parses it into the elements that will eventally make up our user interface.

Here is an example of a slightly more robust document:

```html
<h1>Very Important Heading</h1>

<p>This is an introduction paragraph. Designers typically use "Lorem Ipsum" to fill out space in their designs while they wait for the real content. Lorem Ipsum looks kind of like Latin, but it's actually completely bogus. The nice part is that it has roughly the same distribution of word sizes as English.</p>

<h2>Lorem Ipsum Example</h2>

<p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat. Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur. Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non proident, sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollit anim id est laborum.</p>
```

<div class="try-it">
<h2>Try It: Building a Personal Webpage</h2>

<p> Open your Codepen account and create a new pen. </p>

<p>Use what you know about headings and paragraph tags to create a very simple website with your name, a brief bio, and your contact information. For the sake of our later exercises, make sure it has at least three headings and three paragraphs.</p>
<p>What you create right now is the start of a sandbox/playground where we will try out different styles and behaviors.</p>
</div>

### Images and Attributes

We use HTML tags to "mark up" text to show its semantic meaning. The browser uses these tags to build up document. _Most_ tags have an opening and closing tag, but a few do not. Images—defined using the `<img>` tag do not have a closing tag for instance.

Consider the following:

```html
<img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/s.cdpn.io/t-340/turing.png">
```

There are two things happening here. First, we have an `<img>` tag that is somewhat unique in that it doesn't have a closing tag like all of the others we've see so far.

Our `<img>` tag needs an extra little piece of information. Our browser is more than happy to load up an image, but it'd be helpful if we told it where that image located. That's where the `src` attribute comes in.

<div class="try-it">
<h2>Try It: Adding Images</h2>

<p>Let's update our page from earlier with one or more images.</p>
</div>


### Inputs and Buttons

So far, we've done an excellent job of displaying information to the user, but we haven't really asked them for their input. HTML also includes a set of elements for building forms.

There are a lot to forms that we go into depth on in the full program, but we're going to blissfully ignore today.

Instead we'll focus on two elements:

- `<input>` creates an input field. `<input>` is like `<img>` in that it does not require or support a closing tag. It can take an optional `type` attribute that helps validate user input in some browsers.
- `<button>` creates a button. `<button>` on the other hand does support a closing tag.

We'll use these elements when we discuss JavaScript.

<div class="try-it">
<h2>Try It: Adding Email List Sign Up</h2>

<p>Although we can't make this functional, add an input and a button that mimics signing up for a newsletter.</p>
</div>

### Block Elements: Structuring a Website

The way that we structure a website matters for the people who use it!

`<div>`

The `div` tag is a way you can put related content together into one HTML 'block'. Block elements denote a big section—let’s call it a “block”—of our page. A `div` is like the flavorless Jello of HTML block tags, it don’t have any meaning in and of itself and doesn't come with any built-in styling from the browser.

BUT imagine how people use a website if they are vision impaired? Many people who use the internet do so by using screen readers.

HTML gives us tags like `<article>` and `<aside>` so that we can layout content in a way that a screen reader can easily navigate!

Here [is an example](https://youtu.be/xpP_Km5L46E) of what navigating the web is like if a website is not careful to use semantic tags correctly.

### Conclusion

There are many more HTML tags. But, the ones we learned today are enought to get us started and the raw materials that we'll need to build a game by the end of the day. As the day goes on, we'll slip in some additional tags where it's appropriate, but they meaning and significance should be clear in the context that they're presented.
