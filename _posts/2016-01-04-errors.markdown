There are different kinds of errors that can occur when we run our Ruby programs. Let's force an error. 

```ruby
puts "hello".uppercase
```

```
errors.rb:1:in `<main>': undefined method `uppercase' for "hello":String (NoMethodError)
```

Let's parse through this error to figure out what it's saying. 

Take time to read each Error. They often tell you how to fix the issue. Even if you don't understand them right away, they can be a great starting point when searching for help online.


<div class="try-it">
<h2>Try it: Reading Error Messages</h2>

<p>I'll type each of these lines one at a time into the text editor and run them separately. Can you read the error message to figure out what the problem is?</p>

<p>puts hello</p>
<p>puts "hello</p>
<p>puts "hello" + 5</p>
<p>put "hello"</p>
</div>
