- The "front-end" is the part of the application that users see, touch, and interact with. The "back-end" typically handles stuff like storing information in databases and authenticating users; it's what happens behind the scenes.

- When we're talking about web development, the front-end is the part of the code base that takes care of rendering the user interface in the web browser.

- Over the last decade, the web has evolved from a platform that served static web pages with content to a platform that provides rich, interactive experiences to users.

**So What Makes The Front-End Engineering Cool?**

### It Presents Tons of Logical Challenges

### It Can Be Pretty

### Or Silly

### It Can Guide a User Through a Complicated Task

### Or Help Us Understand a Complicated Subject

Big numbers are difficult to imagine. How can you imagine a billion? Even a thousand things collectively is a challenge. Gun death numbers are big, but the individual events are also significant, which requires care. FiveThirtyEight broke it down in a way that helps with the mental scaling issues.

### It Allows You, As a Developer, to Tell a Story

### You Don't Actually Have to Be a Design Genius

Front-end developers often work with designers, who provide detailed `comps` like the one above. These comps take the guess work out of making a site 'pretty', and allow a front-end developer to focus on managing the complicated interactions of the site.

## What are the technologies used on the front-end?

- The front-end of the web is based on three major technologies:
  - HyperText Markup Language (HTML) defines the structure and semantics of web pages on the web.
  - Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) sets the look and style of a web page. CSS provides style to the structure provided by HTML.
  - JavaScript allows us to define interaction in our pages. What happens when a user clicks on a certain area?
- The back-end of the application can use any number of languages like Ruby and even JavaScript.
