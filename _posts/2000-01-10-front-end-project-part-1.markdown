Congratulations! You know know a bit more about front-end engineering, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Now it's time to put everything together in this paired project.

Both partners will open a new codepen, and you'll work together to bounce ideas of of each other and be an extra pair of eyes when you are stuck.

Let's put everything we've learned together to create a little browser based vending machine!

rules on ids - dash separated, can't start with a number
