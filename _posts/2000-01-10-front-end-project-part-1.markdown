Congratulations! You know know a bit more about front-end engineering, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Now it's time to put everything together in this paired project.

Both partners will fork the base code for the Rock Paper Scissors project and you'll work together to bounce ideas of of each other and be an extra pair of eyes when you are stuck. Remember, you can always ask the TAs and the instructor for help, too!

Let's put everything we've learned together to create a little browser based game!

### Fork the Project & Look Around

In your team, fork this codepen. You can do that by clicking "Edit on Codepen", then clicking "Fork".

<p data-height="265" data-theme-id="0" data-slug-hash="LmMvLd" data-default-tab="js,result" data-user="letak" data-embed-version="2" data-pen-title="Try Coding - Rock Paper Scissors Project" class="codepen">See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/letak/pen/LmMvLd/">Try Coding - Rock Paper Scissors Project</a> by Leta Keane (<a href="https://codepen.io/letak">@letak</a>) on <a href="https://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.</p>

Take a quick tour of the code that is already available to you. You'll see in the JavaScript field, there are comments throughout the code (not standard practice - generally you will not see comments like this; these are here to help you get a sense of what's going on!).

<div class="try-it">
  <h2>Try It: CSS Experiments</h2>

  <p>Open the CSS tab and look at some of the CSS that already exists. You'll see some properties that we haven't discussed yet being used: like box-sizing, margin, etc. These properties control how elements are positioned and sized on the page.</p>

  <p>Try commenting out a line of CSS at random, and see what it does.</p>

  <p>To comment a line out in CSS, wrap the line like this: <br> <br>

  <code> `/* background: red */` </code> <br><br>

  If you are using a Mac, you can hit <code>cmd /</code> on a line to auto comment it.</p>
</div>

### Optional: Customize Your Colors

Spend a few minutes with your partner to change some of the colors. Any hex value (for example: #1ab58f) represents a color that can be changed. Hex values can be comprised any number 0-9 and any letter a-f.

Did you know you can set a background image? Play with the look of your game. Perhaps you want an image of a rock instead of a button with text! (You can add event listeners to images as well as buttons!)

### Target HTML Elements with Javascript

You'll notice that there are three buttons on the page already - one each for Rock, Paper, and Scissors.

If you examine the JavaScript file, you'll see that we've already targeted the Rock button and saved it into a variable. Using the code as a template, create variables for the paper and scissors buttons and target them with JavaScript.

### Conclusion of Part 1

Right now, you might be at the point where you can sort of see the sense that's driving our game. You might not know what all the code is doing, but it's like listening to another language - maybe a few words stand out, maybe you can hazard a guess as to what's being said.

In the next part of our lesson, we'll write some code of our own!
