In this final project, you'll be adding onto the student grouper you just made in the last example. Here are the requirements: 

<div class="try-it">

<p>Upon clicking a button, the user will be prompted to enter student names separated by commas, like this:</p>
<p> Jimmy, Giselle, Emanuel, Ruben, Alexis, Christina, Maria, Victor, Jessica, Ubaldo, Cynthia, David, Jasmine, Gabriel, Saul, Richard</p>
<p>The user will also be prompted to enter a number of students per group (for example, the user enters 4 to indicate that there should be four students per group)</p>
<p>The program generates random groupings of four and then prints out the groupings as list items on the page.</p>
</div>
<br>

Stuck? Work with each other!
