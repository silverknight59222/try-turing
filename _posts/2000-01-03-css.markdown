CSS is a way to add style to HTML documents on the web. It's incredibly powerful!

Let's take a look at some examples of CSS in action:

[CSS Zen Garden](http://www.csszengarden.com)

You'll notice that every single one of these web pages has the exact same HTML - all the differences in layout and look are achieved through CSS!

### Styling Elements

In CSS, we right a bunch of rules for how our document should look. The browser evaluates those rules and styles the page accordingly. A CSS rule is defined as follows:

```css
h1 {
  color: red;
}
```

In the example above, the browser will set the color of any `<h1>` text elements to red. We can define multiple sets of properties and values in a given rule.


<div class="try-it">
<h2>Try It: Adding Color</h2>

<p>First, let's style the body of our page to have a background-color.</p>

<p>Then, give your headings a new color and new font-size.</p>

<p>Next, look into any of the following attributes and choose a few to play around with on your images.</p>
<li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/border">border</a></li>
<li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/background-color">background-color</a></li>
<li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/box-shadow">box-shadow</a></li>
<li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/opacity">opacity</a></li>
<li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/width">width</a></li>
<li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/height">height</a></li>
<li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/margin">margin</a></li>
<li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/padding">padding</a></li>
<li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/font-family">font-family</a></li>
<li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/font-size">font-size</a></li>

<!-- ### Psuedo-selectors

Styling elements is pretty neat, but our elements can be in different states depending on what the user is doing on page. Not only can we style an element with CSS, we can always define specific rules for when a user is hovering or actively clicking on an element.

The following rule will only be in effect when a user is actively hovering over (aka has their mouse on top of but not clicking) an `<a>` element (remember, `<a>` elements are for links!).

```css
a:hover {
  background-color: paleturquoise;
}
```

<div class="try-it">
<h2>Try It: Pseudo Selectors</h2>

<p>Style some of the elements on your personal page using the `:hover` pseudo-selectors. For example, you might try changing the color of your paragraph element font when a user hovers.</p>
</div> -->

### Classes

Right now, we know how to style _all_ of the paragraphs or _all_ of the links on a page. But what if we only wanted to style a particular one?

As it turns out, we can set a `class` attribute on an HTML element. The `class` attribute takes one or more words, separated by spaces. Typically we use classes to describe what kind of element we're creating. For example, we might create a `<p>` element with the `class` of `"sidebar"` to denote that this is a particular kind of section on the page. We might also use classes to describe the kind of content inside of the element.

When we add classes, we make one change in the HTML and one change in the CSS:

```html
<h2 class="heading-main">Lorem Ipsum</h2>
```


```css
.heading-main {
  background-color: yellow;
}
```

This will look for every element—regardless of type—that has the class of `heading-main` and style it with a yellow background color.


<div class="try-it">
<h2>Try It: Adding Classes</h2>

<p>Add a class to just one or two of your paragraphs, then use CSS to add styles for that class. Only those paragraphs should change!</p>
</div>
