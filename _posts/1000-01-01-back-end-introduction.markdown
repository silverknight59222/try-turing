- The "front-end" is the part of the application that users see, touch, and interact with. The "back-end" typically handles stuff like storing information in databases, manipulating that data, authenticating users, etc.; it's what happens behind the scenes.

## What are the technonologies used on the back-end?

* Database: PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, etc.
* Languages and frameworks: Ruby/Rails, Python/Django, Elixir/Phoenix, etc.
* Hosting: Digital Ocean, Heroku

## What are we doing today?

- We'll start by looking at the basic data types in Ruby: strings, integers, floats, arrays
- We'll also figure out how to take in and manipulate user input using control flow structures
- We'll end the day working on a pair project to write a Ruby script that posts to Twitter, reads timelines, and saves search results to files.
