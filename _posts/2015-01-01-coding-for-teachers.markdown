### Did you know teachers make great developers?

Whether you're interested in changing your career or gaining skills to help your students navigate the 21st century, coding is a great skill to add to your teacher toolkit. You already have the critical thinking skills, the capacity to learn things quickly, and the ability to do 50 things at once for 8 hours a day - you're well on your way to becoming a software developer!

## What are we doing today?

Today, we'll dive into front-end engineering and leave with two tools we can use in the classroom: a random student picker, and a random group generator. We'll do this using HTML and JavaScript. 

Not bad for one day, right?

Keep in mind that we're going to place more emphasis on the tools of the front-end trade rather than the design aspects today.
