- The "front-end" is the part of the application that users see, touch, and interact with. The "back-end" typically handles stuff like storing information in databases and authenticating users; it's what happens behind the scenes.
- When we're talking about web development, the front-end is the part of the code base that takes care of renderering the user interface in the web browswer.
- Over the last decade, the web has evolved from a platform that served static web pages with content to a platform that provides rich, interactive experiences to users.

## What are the technonologies used on the front-end?

- On the backend, you can use one of any number of programming languagesâ€”including Ruby.
- The front-end of the web is based on three major technologies:
  - HyperText Markup Language (HTML) defines the structure and semantics of web pages on the web.
  - Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) sets the look and style of a web page. CSS provides style to the structure provided by HTML.
  - JavaScript allows us to define interaction in our pages. What happens when a user clicks on a certain area?

## What are we doing today?

- We're going to learn a bit about how to structure documents using HTML and style them using CSS.
- We'll also cover how to make these pages interactive using JavaScript.
- Finally, we'll break up into pairs and write a small game using the three technologies discussed above.

Not bad for one day, right?
