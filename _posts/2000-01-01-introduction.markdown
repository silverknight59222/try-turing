- The "front-end" is the part of the application that users see, touch, and interact with. The "back-end" typically handles stuff like storing information in databases and authenticating users; it's what happens behind the scenes.

- When we're talking about web development, the front-end is the part of the code base that takes care of rendering the user interface in the web browser.

- Over the last decade, the web has evolved from a platform that served static web pages with content to a platform that provides rich, interactive experiences to users.

**So What Makes The Front-End Engineering Cool?**

### It Presents Tons of Logical Challenges

### It Can Be Pretty

### Or Silly

### It Can Guide a User Through a Complicated Task

### Or Help Us Understand a Complicated Subject

Big numbers are difficult to imagine. How can you imagine a billion? Even a thousand things collectively is a challenge. Gun death numbers are big, but the individual events are also significant, which requires care. FiveThirtyEight broke it down in a way that helps with the mental scaling issues.

### It Allows You, As a Developer, to Tell a Story

### You Don't Actually Have to Be a Design Genius

Front-end developers often work with designers, who provide detailed `comps` like the one above. These comps take the guess work out of making a site 'pretty', and allow a front-end developer to focus on managing the complicated interactions of the site.

### And the Job Market Is Great

## What are the technologies used on the front-end?

- The front-end of the web is based on three major technologies:
  - HyperText Markup Language (HTML) defines the structure and semantics of web pages on the web.
  - Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) sets the look and style of a web page. CSS provides style to the structure provided by HTML.
  - JavaScript allows us to define interaction in our pages. What happens when a user clicks on a certain area?
- The back-end of the application can use any number of languages like Ruby and even JavaScript.

## What are we doing today?

- We're going to learn a bit about how to structure documents using HTML and style them using CSS.
- We'll also cover how to make these pages interactive using CSS transitions and animations.
- React to user events on our page using JavaScript, and jQuery.

Not bad for one day, right?

Keep in mind that we're going to place more emphasis on the tools of the front-end trade rather than the design aspects today.
