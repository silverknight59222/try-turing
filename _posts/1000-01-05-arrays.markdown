You can think of an array in Ruby as a box that can hold things: integers, strings, floats, other arrays, etc. It's a container for other elements. The elements are contained by straight brackets and separated by commas. Any number of elements can be put in an array.

Here are some examples of arrays:

```ruby
animals = ["piglet", "kitten"]
my_numbers = [1,2,3,4,5]
```

## What Can I Do With an Array?

Try these array methods out in IRB. What happens?

```ruby
> animals = ["piglet", "kitten"]
> animals.count
> animals << "penguin"
> animals.count
> animals << "koala"
> animals.count
> puts animals

> animals[0]
> animals.first
> animals[1]
> animals[2]
> animals[3]
> animals.last
```

## Iterating Through Arrays

Create a new file `array_practice.rb` and paste in the following code:

```ruby
foods = ["apples", "bananas", "cookies", "ice cream"]
foods.each do |food|
  puts "I really like #{food}."
end
```

Modify this program to iterate through a list of programming terms and output a sentence "I am learning about (insert term here)" for each of the terms.


<div class="try-it">
<h2>Try It: Multiplication Practice</h2>

<p>Use what you know about arrays to iterate through a list of numbers and output the number multiplied by 5. The example below shows the output if the array was [4,7,8,12]</p>

<pre>4 multiplied by 5 is 20
7 multiplied by 5 is 35
8 multiplied by 5 is 40
12 multiplied by 5 is 60</pre>
Try getting started before looking at the code snippet below. If you're stuck, check out the starter code below:
</div>

```ruby
numbers = [10, 12, 17, 40, 55, 61]

numbers.each do |num|
  # put your code here
end
```
