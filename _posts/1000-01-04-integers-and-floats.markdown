In Ruby, there are two main types of numbers:

* Integer: positive or negative whole number
* Float: positive or negative number with decimal places

Ruby gives us an interactive console called IRB (you can think of it as a "sandbox mode" for Ruby) where we can test things out without having to write them in a file. Let's play around in this console. To get into it, type this:

```
$ irb
```

You'll see a prompt that looks like this:

```
2.2.4 :001 >
```

To get out of it, type exit, then hit the enter key:

```
2.2.4 :001 > exit
```

Go back into IRB and try out the following things. What do you notice? What do you think these "to_f", "to_i", and "to_s" methods do?

```ruby
x = 5
x.to_f
y = 5.6
y.to_i
z = 10
z.to_s
```

## Comparing Values

Just like in middle school math class, we can use comparison operators to compare numbers. The return values are either true or false.

```ruby
5 == 5
3 > 3
3 >= 3
2 < 1
3 != 6
```

Or with variables:

```ruby
child_1 = 10
child_2 = 15

child_1 > child_2
```

Value comparison doesn't just apply to numbers. We can compare the equality of strings as well:

```ruby
message = "hello, world!"
input   = "hello world!"

message == input
message != input
```

<div class="try-it">
<h2>Try It: Guess the Number</h2>

<p>Use what you know about while loops and if/else statements to write a program that sets a secret number, then allows a user to guess. If the number is too high, print "Too high! Guess again." If the number is too low, print "Too low! Guess again." If the number guessed is the secret number, then print "Correct!" and exit the game.</p>

<p>Important: gets stands for "get string". This means that even if the user enters a number, like 9, the computer reads it as "9" (which is not the same as 9). </p>

<pre>Guess a number.
5
Too low! Guess again.
10
Too high! Guess again.
9
Correct!</pre>
Try getting started before looking at the code snippet below. If you're stuck, check out the starter code below:
</div>

```ruby
secret_number = rand(1..10)
guess = 0

while guess != secret_number
  # write your code here
end
```

Done? Try the challenge below! You'll encounter iteration, which we haven't talked about yet. Don't be afraid to do some Googling to find things you can use to solve the challenge. 

<div class="try-it">
<h2>Challenge: FizzBuzz</h2>

<p>Make a program that goes through numbers 1 through 100 and says "Fizz" if the number is divisible by 3, "Buzz" if the number is divisible by 5, and "FizzBuzz" if the number is divisible by both. If the number is not divisible by either 3 or 5, then just print the number.</p>

<pre>1
2
Fizz
4
Buzz
Fizz
7
8
Fizz
Buzz
11
Fizz
13
14
FizzBuzz
...etc</pre>
Try getting started before looking at the code snippet below. If you're stuck, run the starter code below and see if you can modify it to make the FizzBuzz program:
</div>

```ruby
(1..100).each do |num|
  puts num
end
```
