<h2>What is Programming?</h2>

<p>Writing a set of instructions for a computer to execute in order to complete a task.</p>

<h2>Why Ruby?</h2>

<p>Ruby is an open source language that powers applications by companies like Airbnb, Zendesk, Soundcloud, Bloomberg, etc.</p>

<p>Unlike HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, Ruby is considered a "Back End" programming language. This means that you are not going to be designing the visual aspects with Ruby. Instead, you can use ruby to process data, analyze data, run calculations, etc.</p>

<p>Ruby is also a good language to use in order to get a web application up and running quickly. Rails is a framework built using the Ruby programming language that is relatively beginner-friendly.</p>

<p>It's also intuitive. For example:</p>

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/javavsruby.png" alt="">

<h2>What is "Back End"?</h2>

<p>In a broad sense, back-end programming is concerned with managing ​<span class="bold">data</span>​. If we think about our favorite software products, what generally makes them special and useful to us is their ability to do <span class="bold">dynamic</span> things. Many people first interaction with programming by making a simple HTML document -- perhaps an index.html file. This is fun, but the capability of a plain HTML document is fairly limited. Sure, it can display the stuff we write into it, but we'd like it to be able to ​<span class="bold">do</span>​ things -- to record things we tell it, store them for us, maybe play them back in different and interesting formats.</p>

<p>Consider a popular website like Amazon. When we view the front page of Amazon, what are the parts we actually care about? Why did we come here in the first place?</p>

<p>Modern software, and web software especially, is driven by content -- without the content, most of it wouldn't be worth bothering with. And all of that content has to live somewhere. It needs to be stored, retrieved, manipulated, formatted, etc etc. When we talk about "back-end" programming, we're often thinking of the programming tasks involved in making this possible:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Storing data and accessing it later</li>
  <li>Verifying that data is accurate</li>
  <li>Manipulating and analyzing data</li>
  <li>Making sure data can be retrieved quickly and easily</li>
</ul>

<p>The "front-end" is the part of the application that users see, touch, and interact with. The "back-end" typically handles stuff like storing information in databases, manipulating that data, authenticating users, etc.; it's what happens behind the scenes.</p>

<h2>What are the technologies used on the back-end?</h2>

<p>There are numerous technologies that can be used for back-end programming. Here are a few of them:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Languages and frameworks: Ruby/Rails, Python/Django, Elixir/Phoenix, Java/Spring, PHP/Laravel, etc.</li>
  <li>Databases: PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, etc.</li>
  <li>Hosting: Digital Ocean, Heroku</li>
</ul>


## What are we doing today?

- We'll start by looking at a basic data type in Ruby: strings
- We'll disect error messages in Ruby
- We'll figure out how to take in and manipulate user input using if statements and loops
