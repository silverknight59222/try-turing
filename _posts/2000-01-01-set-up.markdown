We will be using a website called [CodePen](https://codepen.io/accounts/signup/user/free) for all of our work today.

<div class="try-it">
  <h2>Try It: Sign Up for a CodePen Account</h2>

  <p>Visit <a href='https://codepen.io/accounts/signup/user/free'>Codepen</a> and sign up for a free account.</p>

  <p></p>
  <p>Take a look around at some of the cool pens! When you're ready, create a 'new pen'!</p>

</div>

#### Navigating

In your new CodePen, you'll see panes for HTML, CSS and JS. The bottom panel will be the output of anything you add to those files!
