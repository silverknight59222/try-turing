## A Helpful Collection of Tips and Tricks

### Doing Things Later

If you look closely at [Sushi Jiggler][], you'll notice that that the animation triggers on a click and then going back to normal. This effect is achieved by adding the class, waiting an amount of time, and then removing it.

Assuming we had an element with a `.sushi` class on it and another class on hand called `.wiggle` we could implement this functionality as follows:

- Listen for events on elements with a `.sushi` class.
- When the user clicks on a `.sushi` element, add the `.wiggle` class using `addClass()`
- Use set `setTimeout` and set a timer for 2000 milliseconds in the future that uses `removeClass()` to remove the class.
- Bingo!

### Generating Random Numbers

JavaScript has a fun function called `Math.random()`. It will generate some crazy decimal between 0 and 1. That's cool, but what if we want to get a number between 1 and 3?

Elementary! Multiply it by three!

Hmmâ€¦ That's still not getting us all the way there. Here are a few numbers that I generated.

- 0.983854177263559
- 1.2686074516508812
- 2.8046332459732235
- 2.249551404129546
- 2.573826382472637
- 2.224357980788116
- 1.2507436439851465
- 1.9703391399107906
- 2.48614382491825

Thay're between 0 and just under 3. We need to add one and then round down. `Math.floor()` will round the number down.

```js
Math.floor(2.48614382491825) === 2; // true!
```

So, what happens if we do `Math.floor(Math.random() * 3 + 1)`?

- 2
- 3
- 1
- 2
- 3
- 1
- 3
- 2

We did it! ðŸŽ‰

### Getting a Particular Element By Index

Let's say that you had three or so boxes and you wanted to mark one of them as the correct answer. How would you do that? There is a special jQuery selector that lets you pick a particular element.

Our random number is 2.

```js
$('.box:eq(2)').addClass('correct-answer');
```

Then we could add an event listener to each of the boxes. When the user clicks, we'll look at the element they clicked on and use the `hasClass()` to see if it has the `.correct-answer` class.
