Thank you for spending your weekend with us! 

If you enjoyed coding today, here are some resources that can help you keep going and learn more about Turing!

Check out the Prework for a taste of the ways we ask our students to prepare before they get to the program.

* [Turing Front End PreWork](http://frontend.turing.io/prework/)
* [Turing Back End PreWork](http://backend.turing.io/prework/)

You can also check out [Jennifer Dewalt's Website](https://jenniferdewalt.com/) for some front-end project inspiration. 

If you want to publish your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as a live website, check out [this GitHub Pages Tutorial](http://docs.pinegrow.com/host-html-website-github-pages-free/), which will guide you through the process of taking the code you wrote today and publishing it live so that you can show the world!

We hope you enjoyed the day and that we see you around soon!
