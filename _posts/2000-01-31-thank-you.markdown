Thank you for spending your day with us! 

If you enjoyed coding today, here are some resources that can help you keep going and learn more about Turing!

Check out the [Turing PreWork](http://frontend.turing.io/prework/) for a taste of the ways we ask our students to prepare before they get to the program.

Want to code without CodePen? Here is [a basic template to get started with HTML, CSS and JavaScript](https://github.com/adrianbautista/html-css-template) without using something like CodePen!

You have super powers now! You can use some of the tricks you learned today to mess around in your browser's inspector tools! Here is [a fun walkthrough](https://www.mvcode.com/lessons/hack-session-hack-with-html) on how to do this using Chrome.

We hope you enjoyed the day and that we see you around soon!
