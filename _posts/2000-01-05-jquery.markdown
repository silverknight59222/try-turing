jQuery is a library that allows us to use CSS selectors to find elements on the page and then interact with them.

Let's say that we have a page with the following markup?

```html
<h1 class="important-header">Dinosaurs are awesome.</h1>
```

We could change the text programatically.

```js
$('h1').text('I AM A DINOSAUR.');
```
