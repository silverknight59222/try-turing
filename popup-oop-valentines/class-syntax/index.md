# Class Syntax

We've talked at a high level about classes and attributes, and you may be starting to wonder what this will look like in code!


EXPLORE
- give them syntax for a simple class with one attribute as arg
- two objects are being made and printed
- ask guiding questions

STAMP
- clarify what is happening - draw diagram or have iPad connected??

YOU DO
- write a class for YOUR object that you identified in previous activity!
