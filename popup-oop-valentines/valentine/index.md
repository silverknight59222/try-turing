# Valentine Generator

Now that we have an understanding of OOP and have used some Ruby syntax to write classes and create objects from them, we are ready to write a program that generates Valentine messages!

Use this starter kit - class frame and one piece of data passed through, ONE object is being created

Chat Brainstorm - what are some of the attributes you would have in a valentines message?
- message, from, ?? who knows what else

Directions:
- add 2 attributes to your class
- make a few more objects
- print, is everything showing up as you expect?

## Extension

store a group of valentines in an array and print ALL at the same time!
