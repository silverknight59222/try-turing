# Valentine Generator

Now that we have an understanding of OOP and have used some Ruby syntax to write classes and create objects from them, we are ready to write a program that generates Valentine messages!

<div class="try-it-new">
  <h2>Brainstorm</h2>
  <p>What are some attributes you would have in a valentines message? The one we are starting with is <em>recipient</em>.</p>
</div>

<div class="try-it-new">
  <h2>Customize your Valentine</h2>
  <p>Use <a target="blank" href="https://repl.it/@turingschool/valentines-starter#main.rb">this repl.it</a> as a starter kit. It has the code for a Valentine class, and what we call a <em>method</em>. It currently has only one attribute and is creating one instance.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Add at least 2 more attributes to your class.</li>
    <li>Create several more objects.</li>
    <li>Run your repl.it file to make sure you can see your Valentine messages!</li>
  </ul>
</div>

## Extension

store a group of valentines in an array and print ALL at the same time!
