# Semantic HTML

<a href="../">Back to Curriculum Index</a>

## Goals

- Build an understanding of how our HTML impacts users that use some assistive technologies
- Learn and implement best practices for headings
- Learn and implement alternatives to the `div` element, and why they are important

## Affordances

<img src="./assets/teapot.png" alt="Short, squatty, turquoise cast iron teapot with dragonfly carved into top" />

An afforance is a clue about what and object is and how it should be used. In the physical world, when we see a teapot or an ice cream scoop or a pair of headphones, we may have never seen that exact item before, but can use context to understand what it is and how one would use it.

In the digital world, when we see a form, a button, items on a page change when we hover over them, etc. we have context for what they mean and what we can do with them. If a user can't see a button on the page, we have to provide that information in a way that their assistive technology can communicate it to them.

Using semantic HTML is one way we can provide affordances to all users.

## Website Navigation

One of the reasons that using semantic HTML matters, is it provides for a better experience for users to navigate our sites and apps.

### Screen Readers

Screen readers are software programs that allow blind or low vision users to read the text on a computer screen. It can be read either through a speech synthesizer or braille display. A user that uses a screen reader will use a keyboard or Braille input device to tab through a webpage.

There is a long list of available screen readers. Some popular ones are [NVDA](https://www.nvaccess.org/), [JAWS](https://www.freedomscientific.com/products/software/jaws/) and [VoiceOver](https://www.apple.com/accessibility/mac/vision/) (comes with Mac).

### Motor & Dexterity

Users may have permanent, temporary, or situational motor and/or dexterity impairments. They might be using the keyboard, head or eye tracking software, [switch controls](https://axesslab.com/switches/#:~:text=A%20switch%20is%20an%20assistive,you%20design%20switch%20friendly%20interfaces.), voice dictations, etc.

We won't get into the nitty gritty of each of these, but what we need to know is: our code must be written in a way that these assistive technologies can do their job. We can't make any assumptions and have to provide information explicitly.

## Headings

Heading tags (for example `<h1>`) can help users get a sense of the structure and organization of a page. When used correctly, screen reader users can also quickly understand the structure of the page and navigate it efficiently. They can listen to a list of all the headings and skip to a heading of their choice. In 2017, [a survey was conducted](https://webaim.org/projects/screenreadersurvey7/#finding) where almost 70% of screen reader users who responded shared that they are most likely to use headings to navigate a length web page.

Best practices for headings:
- All pages should have an `<h1>` giving the title of the page
- Don't skip heading levels (for example, jumping from `<h1>` to an `<h4>`)
- Don't choose a heading level because of the size that the browser displays. Use CSS to control the size
- Don't use a **bold** paragraph instead of a heading

## Images

Anytime we display an image on a webpage, we are probably doing it to add some sort of value to the users experience: show them what a product looks like, invoke some emotion to draw them in, etc. If a user can't see that image, they are missing out on the experience _you_ want to give them, and that _they_ deserve.

Why might a user not be able to see the image?
- Blindness or low vision
- Slow internet connection
- Error with the source of the image

To remedy this, we can provide alternate text using the `alt` attribute on an image.

```html
<img src="some URL" alt="Light brown labrador puppy bouncing over a field of yellow flowers" />
```

If you have a meme on a site (or any image with text overlay), ensure that your alt text includes a description of the image _and_ the text.

## Emojis

This [blog post](https://dev.to/finallynero/accessible-emojis--1pjh) nicely lays out what we need to do to make an emoji accessible. We will use two ARIA attributes! The snippet below shows a completed example:

```html
<p>Coding is so fun! 
  <span role="img" aria-label="starry eyes">ðŸ¤©</span>
</p>
```

1. Wrap the emoji in a `<span>` element so we can provide additional information to the browser
2. Tell the browser this is an image (`role="img"`)
3. Give a name for this specific emoji (`aria-label="starry eyes"`)

<div class="try-it-new">
  <h3>Try It: Incorporating Images</h3>
  <p>Add an image or two, and an emoji or two if you'd like! <a href="https://www.pexels.com/" target="blank">Pexels</a> is a great resource for stock images. The emoji keyboard can be pulled up on a Mac with <code class="try-it-code">ctrl + cmd + space</code> and on Windows with <code class="try-it-code">Windows + .</code>.</p>
  <p>Run the Lighthouse Audit to make sure you don't have any violations in regard to these additions. If you do, address them, then run the check again!</p>

## Image/Emoji Best Practices Summary

In web development:
- Wrap emojis in a span and inclue `role` and `aria-label` attributes
- Provide `alt` text for images. If the image includes text overlay, that should be included in the `alt` text

As a social media user:
- [Consider limiting emojis](https://twitter.com/aardrian/status/1159066496540319744?lang=en)
- [Capitalize each word in your hashtags](https://twitter.com/LareneLg/status/1271677933149536256)
- Thread or include in original post the `alt` text of an image


## Containers

Earlier, we learned about the `<div>` element. We talked about how it can be used to visually group other elements together.

Sometimes, we use container elements, like a `div` purely to control layout. Other times, we group elements together becauase the content is related. Consider the screenshots below:

<br />
<img src="./assets/amazon-footer.png" alt="Screenshot of amazon.com homepage footer with over 40 links. Links appear in white text on a dark blue background." />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<img src="./assets/linkedin-header.png" alt="Screenshot of linkedin.com user homepage, focusing on the nav bar. Nav bar includes a company icon, search bar, and icons/links/subtitles for home, my network, jobs, messaging, notifications, me, and work. Header is a dark blue color, and page below it has a white background." />
<br />

If those groups of links/icons live inside of a `<div>`, a screen reader user may not have the context for the purpose of said `<div>`. By using more semantic elements, we can communicate more to the screen reader, which will provide a better experience to the user.

Semantic container tags:
- `<main>` should wrap the main content of your page. With this, the user can "skip to main content"
- `<nav>` should wrap any sort of nav or menu bar
- `<footer>` should wrap any content in a container at the bottom of a page

<div class="try-it-new">
  <h3>Try It: Semantic Containers</h3>
  <p>Wrap a <code class="try-it-code">main</code> element around the main content of your page. If you have a menu or navigation bar, wrap it in a <code class="try-it-code">nav</code> element, same for footer</p>
  <p>Refactor your HTML so that any <code class="try-it-code">div</code> elements that make sense to be something else are changed.</p>
  <p>Check your live site in the browser. In theory, you should see no change!</p>
</div>

## Manual Testing

Automated tests might not be able to do it all. It's important to use a combination of the automated tests available, as well as doing some manual testing. We will only use one test in addition to Lighthouse today!

### Validate Markup

Another thing we can check manually, is that our markup, or HTML, doesn't have any violations. W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) provides a [free markup validation service](https://validator.w3.org/).

For our purposes, we can use this 1 of 2 ways:
1. Provide the link for our live repl site (under Validate by URI)
2. Copy and paste all the code from our HTML file (under Validate by Direct Input)

While violations caught by this may have a lot of cross-over with Lighthouse, it can never hurt to check with as many reputable testing options as possible.

<div class="try-it-new">
  <h3>Try It: Validate Your Markup</h3>
  <p>Run your HTML through the <a href="https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input">W3C Markup Validation Service</a>. If you have any violations, share them in the chat and we can problem solve together!</p>
