# Pop Up: Object Oriented Programming

In this live, instructor-led workshop, you will build and customize your very own computer program while learning the fundamentals of Object-Oriented Programming!

_This will be best experienced on a desktop or laptop computer._

## Welcome!

We are so glad you are here! To get set up...
1. Open up <a target="blank" href="http://repl.it/">repl.it</a> in a browser (preferably Chrome) and log in to your account
1. Please change your zoom name to first, last initial, pronouns (ex: _Amy H. (she/her)_)
1. Introduce yourself in the zoom chat - where are you calling in from?
<br><br>

## Goals

- Explain the core concepts of Object-Oriented Programming
- Gain _exposure_ and familiarity with the Ruby syntax for classes and instances
- Determine if coding is something you enjoy doing and want to pursue further

Disclaimer: We won't become experts in Ruby or Object-Oriented Programming today. And you may leave with more questions than answers!
<br><br>

## Programming Concepts We Will Use

Back-End Engineering is concerned with the management of data for an application. There are different ways we can structure the data itself as well as the systems that manage it. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is one way to design a program to manage the data in a Back-End.

While OOP is not exclusive to Ruby, the Ruby programming languages usually follows the patterns of OOP.

    <h3>Ruby</h3>
    <p>Ruby is the programming lanugage we will write in today, to give instructions to the computer. It's known to be a beginner friendly language because of it's syntax and similarities to the English language!</p>

    <h3>OOP</h3>
    <p>Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that we can use with many lanuages, including Ruby and Python. It focuses on writing re-usable code.</p>

## Brief Ruby + repl.it Intro

To gain some familiarity with repl.it, the interface we will use to write code in today, and start looking at some Ruby code, click [this link](https://repl.it/@turingschool/Ruby-Replit-Intro#main.rb). To start, you'll first need to click the blue "Fork" button.

![Screenshot of repl interface with arrow pointing to top right corner, fork button](./assets/repl-fork.png)

1. Change the text `NAME` on line 2 to your name
1. Click the green run/play button at the top center of the page

<div class="try-it-new">
  <h2>Write some Code!</h2>
  <p>Now that we've seen what variables can do and how to run our code, let's add on to what is existing. Write at least 2 more variables under line 2. Print all variables out, and re-run the code to make sure they are working as expected!</p>
</div>
