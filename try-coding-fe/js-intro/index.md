# JavaScript Introduction

JavaScript is a language that allows us to _interact_ with a webpage. We can write JavaScript that can access HTML elements and change their appearance or content based on the way a user interacts with the page.

## Forking Your First Replit

Replit is a web-based interactive development environment or IDE. It allows us to write code and see the output in the console at the same time. To get started today, we will be working in <a href="https://replit.com/@turingschool/js-sandbox?v=1#index.html" target="blank">this JavaScript sandbox replit</a>. When you open this replit, click the blue "Fork Repl" button to make your own copy on your account. From here, you can add code or delete code as much as you like. It's yours!

A sandbox is a place where we can play around with code! Use this space to take notes or try things throughout the workshop today.

<div class='module-card fe-project-card'>
  <p class='standout'>Important Note:</p>
  <p>In order to run the code, click on "Dev Tools" to see the console where the code will print out, then click the green "Run" button.</p>
</div>

## console.log()

In your sandbox replit, complete the activity that follows.

<div class="try-it-new">
  <h3>Try It: Exploring console.log()</h3>
  <p>Read the JavaScript code and then run it.</p>
  <p>What does the output tell you about the job of the <code>console.log()</code> command?</p>
</div>

<div class="expander expander-lesson">
  <header>
    <h3 class="spicy-click">Takeaways</h3>
    <div>
      <button class="expander-btn">
          <img
            src="../../assets/icons/arrow.svg"
            alt="expander arrow icon" />
      </button>
    </div>
  </header>
  <div class="hide">
    <ul>
      <li><code>console.log()</code> is a <code>command</code> that is built into the JavaScript language</li>
      <li><code>console.log()</code> will print the value it is instructed to print and creates a line break after printing the data</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</div>
<br>

## Variables

In order to store a piece of data and reference it later, possibly many times throughout our code, we need to use variables. You can think of a variable like a storage container with a label on it where we can hold items we care about. In JavaScript we define variables by typing the keyword <code>var</code> followed by the name of the variable we wish to create, the assignment operator (<code>=</code>), and then the value we want to store in that variable. We end each statement in our code with a semi-colon.

When working with JavaScript, we use <code>camelCase</code> for variable names, which means that words are joined without spaces, and each new word begins with a capital letter.

```javascript
var email = 'helloworld@gmail.com';
var firstName = 'Brandi';
var location = 'Tampa, FL ðŸŒ´';
```

<div class="try-it-new">
  <h3>Try It: Variables in JavaScript</h3>
  <p>Back in your sandbox replit, declare three variables that describe yourself. Use console.log() with each variable name to confirm that youâ€™ve done this correctly!</p>
</div>

## Data Types

In JavaScript, your data (information) can be different types. There are two data types we will be working with today: Number (any numeric value), and String (words or phrases like "JavaScript is fun!"). We use the Number data type if we are storing data that may be manipulated in some way. We use the String data type if our data needs to remain consistent. With String data, anything inside of the quotation marks is preserved.

<div class="module-card fe-project-card">
  <h3>Deciding on a Data Type</h3>
  <p>For each item listed below, determine which data type is most appropriate for the information.
  <ul>
    <li>Username</li>
    <li>Age</li>
    <li>Zip Code</li>
    <li>Balance on a bank account</li>
    <li>Caption for an image</li>
  </ul>
  </p>
</div>

<div class="try-it-new">
  <h3>Try It: Data Types</h3>
  <p>Back in your replit, add two more variables assigned to Number values. Use console.log() to verify that the data was stored in the variable as expected!</p>
</div>

## User Input

Our programs havenâ€™t been very exciting so far because we already know what will happen just by looking at the code. What if your program incorporated dynamic input from the user?

**Explore**

1. <a href="https://replit.com/@turingschool/ColdPowderblueMeasurements" target="blank">Read the code in this replit</a> and _guess_ what it will do. It is also available below, if you prefer to preview it here.
2. Run the program. It's interactive! Be ready to type in your answers in the console area.

  <div class="hide">
    <ul>
      <li>Instead of manually typing in every value, we can collect values from our user to provide a dynamic experience.</li>
      <li>When the code is run, it will stop at <code>gets.chomp</code> and wait for the user to type input into the console.</li>
      <li><code>gets</code> collects a string from the console and chomp removes the final character which is the enter/return.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

<div class="try-it-new">
  <h3>Try It: Getting User Input</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>In your sandbox replit, write a small program that asks the user for their name and responds with a sentence of your choice!</li>
    <li>Now, add on to your program and ask your user two more questions. If youâ€™re not feeling creative, ask them how they are feeling today or their best friendâ€™s name! Try running your program a few times with different values stored in the variables each time.</li>
  </ol>
