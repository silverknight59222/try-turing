# Front-End Workshop: Build a Number Guesser

_This will be best experienced on a desktop or laptop computer._

## Welcome!

We are so glad you are here! To get set up...
1. Open up <a target="blank" href="http://codepen.io/">CodePen</a> in a browser (preferably Chrome) and log in to your account
1. Please change your zoom name to first, last initial, pronouns (ex: _Amy H. (she/her)_)
<br><br>

## What to Expect

Over the course of the day, we will write code, explore the mindsets that successful developers have, and learn a little more about Turing. We will ask you to introduce yourself, ask questions, and occasionally share out answers to the technical work we do! Below is our agenda for the day (all in MST):

- **9:00 - 9:15** Welcome, Intros, Setup
- **9:15 - 11:45** Instruction (with breaks!)
- **11:45 - 12:15** Turing Info
- **12:15 - 1:00** Alumni Panel
<br><br>

## Goals

- Build and customize a virtual Number Guesser Game
- Gain _exposure_ and familiarity with some HTML and JavaScript
- Determine if coding is something you enjoy doing and want to pursue further, and get a feel for what Turing is all about

Disclaimer: We won't become experts in these languages today. And you may leave with more questions than answers!

## Programming Languages We Will Use

Building the user-facing part of a website or app is referred to as Front-End Engineering. Building a Front-End requires the writing code in three programming languages, and making the code in each language "talk to" the code in the others.

It can feel like a lot, but let's start by building an understanding of what each language is responsible for. We will make some comparisons to the human body to create context.

<section class="data-type-cards language-cards">
  <div>
    <h3>HTML</h3>
    <p>HTML holds the content we see on a page (text, images) and defines the structure and order in which the content appears.</p>
    <p>We can think of HTML as the skeleton of our webpage; without it, we'd just be a blob:</p>
    <img class="medium-img" src="./assets/html.png" alt="Drawing of human skeleton" />
  </div>

  <div>
    <h3>JavaScript</h3>
    <p>JavaScript is what lets the user interact with a page. For example, clicking a button and getting some sort of response.</p>
    <p>We can think of JavaScript as the brain and muscle of our webpage, as it powers all the action:</p>
    <img class="medium-img" src="./assets/js.png" alt="Drawing of human skeleton" />
  </div>
</section>

## Now, it gets even more fun:
- [Working with Numbers and Conditionals](./js-1)
- [Connecting HTML & JavaScript](./js-2)
- [Building Dynamic User Experiences](./js-3)
- [Extensions](./extensions)
- [Wrap Up](./wrap-up)
