# Part 1: Online Application

Your first step for applying to be a Turing student is to complete the online application at <a target="blank" href="https://apply.turing.edu/">apply.turing.edu</a>. The online application has two parts:

## Basic Info

Your name, email, phone number, etc. The basics.

## More About You

Tell us your story! We want to understand what you've done in your past. There are no must-have items here. We've had students come to Turing straight out of high school, others with college degrees and some with decades of work experience. 

You will answer a few questions in 3-5 sentences that will help us learn more about you. You'll also have the option of uploading a resume.
