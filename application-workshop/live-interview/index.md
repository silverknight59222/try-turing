# Part 2: Live Interview

## Preparation

To prepare for the interview, please ensure you have:

- a computer with a working camera to ensure the best communication
- a distraction-free environment

If you do not currently have a work environment conducive to a successful interview, please feel free to reschedule until you can secure the best setup for your success.

## Overview

The 1:1 live interview will be held on zoom with you and a Turing alum. The interview will consist of two main components: 

- **Problem Solving Challenge:** You will work through a challenge to show off your communication, logical reasoning, and collaboration. There is no pre-work or prior knowledge needed to be successful in this challenge.
- **Interview Questions**: During the remainder of the interview, you can expect to discuss your previous experiences, your strengths, and your motivation for pursuing a career in software development.


## Problem Solving Challenge

Tips:
- Communicate, communicate, communicate! It’s less about solving the problem and more about how you communicate your thoughts and work with your interviewer. This is an effort to simulate how you might work with a partner at Turing in a remote environment.
- You can and should ask clarifying questions and let the interviewer know if you’re stuck. Your interviewer may ask you to verbalize your thoughts if they are not following.
- We'd like to see some self-reflection after you complete the challenge. We want you to be able to speak to what you learned and what you might do differently if given a second attempt.

  <h3>Try It: Problem Solving Challenge</h3>
  <p>While we can't show you the exact challenge you'll recieve on interview day, let's look at <strong><a target="blank" href="https://api.razzlepuzzles.com/dot_connect">this exercise</a></strong> and practice some of the tips above.</p>
  <p>I will model solving this challenge <strong>two times</strong>. Pay attention to what communication and collaboration skills I'm displaying each time. After each attempt, let's think about the following questions:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>What communication skills did you see?</li>
    <li>What collaboration skills did you see?</li>
    <li>From what you saw, what would it be like to work with me on a project?</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Now that you've seen two options for approaching this problem, what are some things you can commit to doing in your interview?</p>

## Interview Questions

Tips:
- It’s important that you answer the behavioral questions directly and with examples from your previous experience. For example, if we ask you to tell us about a time where you worked on a successful team, you should answer with a specific instance and avoid only speaking in vague terms.
- Be prepared to discuss how you align with Turing's mission: *Turing’s mission is to unlock human potential by training a diverse and inclusive student body to succeed in high fulfillment technical careers.*
