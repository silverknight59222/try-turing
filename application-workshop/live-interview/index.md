# Part 2: Live Interview

## Overview

The 1:1 live interview will be held on zoom with you and a Turing alum. The interview will consist of two main components: 

- **Logic Puzzle:** The logic puzzle is a timed, 30-minute assessment during which you have the opportunity to showcase your communication, collaboration, and problem solving skills. 
- **Interview Questions**: During the remainder of the interview, you can expect to discuss your previous experiences, your strengths, and your motivation for pursuing a career in software development.

## Preparation

To prepare for the interview, please ensure you have:

- a way to take notes and draw diagrams for the logic portion
- a computer with a working camera to ensure the best communication
- a distraction-free environment

If you do not currently have a work environment conducive to a successful interview, please feel free to reschedule until you can secure the best setup for your success.

## Tips From Our Interview Team
**Logic Puzzle**
Note - This portion looks slightly different depending on if you are applying for the FE, BE, or Launch program. Regardless of the structure, all of these tips are relevant:
- The logic portion of the interview should not feel like an independent, proctored exam. This portion of the live interview is less about getting the questions right and more trying to simulate how you would interact with another student in a remote environment. Your interviewer will play the part of your collaborator and wants to hear your ideas and support you through the questions. **You've already proven in the online application that you can get these answers right. Now show us how you collaborate!**
- The time limit of the logic portion is not meant to be punitive. Don't let the pressure of the clock force you into randomly guessing. Stick to the strategies you used when you completed the online application and remember the previous bullet point.   
  
**Interview Questions**
- It’s important that you answer the behavioral questions directly and with examples from your previous experience. For example, if we ask you to tell us about a time where you worked on a successful team, you should answer with a specific instance and avoid only speaking in vague terms.
- Be prepared to discuss how you align with Turing's mission: *Turing’s mission is to unlock human potential by training a diverse and inclusive student body to succeed in high fulfillment technical careers.*
