# Extension Challenge

Now that we have finished our FAQ page, see if you can change the content to be a topic of interest. What do you want your FAQ page to be about? Here are some suggested topics to help you get those creative juices flowing: National Parks, Climate Change, Geography, Music, Pop Culture, or anything else you are interested in!

## Goals

- Update content to a topic of your choice.
- Update CSS colors or fonts.
- Implement a new feature! 

### Update Content

In your HTML file, update the question and answer content to reflect your new topic of choice.

### Update Styles

In your CSS file, change the colors to reflect the content you chose. You can also play with other CSS properties to achieve a look that you like! If you want some guidance on color combinations, <a href="https://coolors.co/" target="blank">coolors.co</a> is a great tool. <a href="https://www.canva.com/learn/100-color-combinations/" target="blank">This article</a> from canva also has color combinations that work well together.

### Implement A New Feature

In your JavaScript file, try to add another feature. 
- Can you show the answer section on hover instead of on click? 
- Can you use another event listener to change something else on your page? 
- How would you change your app to be a true or false mini-quiz instead of FAQ?

Congratulations on your hard work today! We covered a lot of information and now you have an awesome web page to share with friends and family. Maybe you even discovered a hidden talent for coding today! ðŸ˜‰
