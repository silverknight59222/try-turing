# Extension Challenge

Now that we have finished our interactive webpage, we will work in teams to extend our learning. You will take the page you designed and update the page to build an informative webpage for a topic of interest. To prepare for this challenge when we return from lunch, <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdMkjKllXg9XkRFQYA5puIlUSL73qDJnTdtXyEvO91l-i6oFQ/viewform" target="blank">please complete this survey</a>.

## Directions

You will be assigned to a new group for the challenge based on a shared interest that you and your group members chose. <strong>Everyone will continue to work on their own project</strong>, but you can use each other as resources. If you find something cool, share it with the rest of the group! Challenge yourself to get the most out of this experience by doing at least one of these things:

- Volunteer to share your code (broken or working!)
- Ask a question (Ex: How would I make this happen when the user clicks the button?)
- Rebuild your project starting from scratch in a new replit


## Goals

- Update the content in the HTML
- Update the CSS colors or fonts to represent the topic your group chose
- Implement new features using event listeners

### Update Content

In your HTML file, update the content to reflect your new topic.

### Update Styles

In your CSS file, change the colors to reflect the content you chose. You can also play with other CSS properties to achieve a look that you like! If you want some guidance on color combinations, <a href="https://coolors.co/" target="blank">coolors.co</a> is a great tool. <a href="https://www.canva.com/learn/100-color-combinations/" target="blank">This article</a> from canva also has color combinations that work well together.

### Implement A New Feature

In your JavaScript file, try to add another feature. 
- Can you show the card text on hover instead of on click? 
- Can you use another event listener to change something else on your page? 
- How could you modify your app to be a true or false mini-quiz?

## Presentations

When we return to the main room, one person from each group will share what they built. Be prepared to share:
- Your screen! We want to see your work and the topic your group was working on.
- A challenge you encountered while completing the project.
- A win you experienced during the work time.

Congratulations on your hard work today! We covered a lot of information and now you have an awesome web page to share with friends and family. Maybe you even discovered a hidden talent for coding today! ðŸ˜‰
