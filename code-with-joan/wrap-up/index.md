# Wrap Up

One final step... let's make sure everyone can find the link to share your FAQ page with the world.

You can find the live URL above the "mini browser". Copy and paste the link, or click the button in the far-right to open it in a new tab. Have fun! ðŸŽ‰

## Next Steps

Are you in love with coding? Here are some great places to start exploring:
- Attend another Try Coding workshop where you'll go a bit more in depth as to how things work in a given language, and explore the difference between Front-End and Back-End Engineering
- Get more exposure and gain comfort with the syntax by working through one of [Codecademy's free tutorials](https://www.codecademy.com/)
