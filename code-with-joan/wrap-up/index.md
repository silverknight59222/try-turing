# Code with Joan: Wrap-Up

You did it! <span role="img" aria-label="celebration emoji">ðŸŽ‰</span> Thank you so much for spending your Friday with us. I hope that thinking about your reason for why you came, you feel like this time was well-spent and you gained some new knowledge, whether that's about code, Turing, or even yourself!

<strong>Please share about your experience, and how we can best support you moving forward, by completing <a target="blank" href="https://forms.gle/UuK9XBgMKFWxKGu77">this survey</a>.</strong>


## Share It!
