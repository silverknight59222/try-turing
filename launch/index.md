# Try Coding: Launch

Please sign up for a free <a target="blank" href="https://replit.com/~">replit.com</a> account before beginning this workshop.

## Welcome

- Open up <a target="blank" href="https://replit.com/~">replit.com</a> in a browser (preferably Chrome) and log into your account.
- Change your Zoom display name to your first name, last initial, and pronouns – Kaitlyn V. (she/her). To do that, hover over your image in the gallery view, click the three dots, and select Rename.
- Heads up! We will ask you to introduce yourself in a moment.

## What to Expect

Over the course of this session, we will write code, practice the habits of successful developers, and learn a little more about Turing. We will ask you to introduce yourself, ask questions, and occasionally share answers to the technical work we do! By the end of today, you will build your very own “Guess the Number” console game. Below is our agenda for the day:

- Welcome & Introductions (15 minutes)
- Instruction (2 hours)
- Turing Information Session (30 minutes)
- Wrap-Up (15 minutes)


## Learning Norms

- No question is too small and no question is a bad question. Ask them!
- We all benefit from each other's ideas! Push yourself to share at least one time today.
- Keep your camera on during the session (if you can).
- **Questions?** Type into the zoom chat, raise your hand, or come off of mute! Please avoid direct messages unless it is a specific issue only to yourself.
- **Disconnected?** Jump back on!

## Zoom Practice

There are several ways to get my attention throughout the workshop today. Let’s practice using some of these tools now.
- **Type in the chat to everyone.** What is your favorite genre of music?
- **Send the instructor a direct message.** What word describes how you are feeling today?
- **Raise your hand.** Find your zoom toolbar, click Reactions, then Raise Hand.
- **Introduce yourself!** Share your name, pronouns, and your location. Then, share why you’re here.
1. I'm curious about what a software developer does.
3. A teacher or mentor suggested I check this out.
4. I know I want to be in a tech career, I'm excited to take the first steps in that direction!
