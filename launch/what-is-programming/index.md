# What is Programming?

Computer programmers create the systems that we use for interacting with lots of different technologies: the computer you are using right now, your cellphone, even the electronic systems in many vehicles.  A programmer's job is to translate what a user wants to accomplish into instructions that the computer can understand and execute.

## The Language of Computers

If computers understood the languages that humans use to communicate with each other, there might be no need for programmers.  But, computers do not inherently understand anything other than the most basic commands - like 'on' and 'off'.  So, it is the job of a programmer to combine basic commands into more complex functionality.

Programmers use specific languages to give instructions to a computer - these languages translate what a human might ask of a computer into a format that the computer can understand and execute.

There are many different languages for developing computer programs. Some common ones are C#, Javascript, Ruby and Python (there are MANY others).  Before a programmer can start developing software, they need to choose and learn one of these languages.

Today, we are going to start learning the Ruby language.  It is a great intro to programming, and the _concepts_ that we learn today can be used in _any programming language_.
