# Group Challenge

Now that we have finished our interactive webpage, we will work in teams to extend our learning. You will take the page you designed and update the page to build an informative webpage for a topic of interest. To prepare for this challenge when we return from lunch, <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdEE0Oh0yxmAQIPnlRBaSohzQjOpx5zxzTPxi7Edx7EMHfGJg/viewform" target="blank">please complete this survey</a>.

## Directions

You will be assigned to a new group for the challenge based on a shared interest that you and your group members chose. Each group will receive a client and specific objectives for their project. <strong>Everyone will continue to work on their own project</strong>, but you can use each other as resources. If you find something cool, share it with the rest of the group! Challenge yourself to get the most out of this experience by doing at least one of these things:

- Volunteer to share your code (broken or working!)
- Ask a question (Ex: How would I make this happen when the user clicks the button?)

## Clients and Objectives
<strong>No peeking!</strong> Once you join your group, you'll look together at your challenge requirements. Each group has a client closely tied to their selected topic. Your client has some specific asks for your project. Can you help them achieve their goals?!

## Stretch Ideas
Finished your webpage and want another challenge? Look into one of these ideas to take your project to the next level:
- Use <a href="https://fonts.google.com/" target="blank">Google Fonts for specific fonts for your page</a>.
- Use <a href="https://coolors.co/" target="blank">coolors.co</a> to implement a color palette that will work for your client.
- Use images on your page. <a href="https://css-tricks.com/" target="blank">CSS Tricks</a> has some great articles on making your images responsive.
- Use <a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/" target="blank">Flexbox</a> to layout your cards in a different way.

## Presentations

When we return to the main room, one person from each group will share what they built. Be prepared to share:
- Your screen! We want to see your work and the topic your group was working on.
- A challenge you encountered while completing the project.
- A win you experienced during the work time.

Congratulations on your hard work today! We covered a lot of information and now you have an awesome web page to share with friends and family. Maybe you even discovered a hidden talent for coding today! üòâ
