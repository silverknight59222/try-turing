# Welcome to Try Coding!

### To Get Set Up:

- Open up <a target="blank" href="http://codepen.io/">codepen.io</a> in a browser (preferably Chrome) and login to your account
- In another tab, open up <a target="blank" href="https://try.turing.io/">try.turing.io</a>
- Make sure you have a fully charged computer or a charger close by
- We recommend using headphones and finding a quiet work space to limit distractions

### What to Expect

Over the course of the day, we will write code, explore the mindsets that successful developers have, and learn a little more about Turing.  We will ask you to introduce yourself, ask questions, and occasionally share out answers to the technical work we do! Below is our agenda for the day:

- **10:00 - 11:45** Welcome, Intros, and Instruction (1 break)
- **11:45 - 12:00** Break
- **12:00 - 12:30** Student/Alum Panel, Turing Info
- **12:30 - 2:15**  Instruction (2 breaks)
- **2:15  - 2:30**  Wrap Up
