# Programming is Hard

## Goals

- Develop an understanding for the type of mindset a developer must have
- Start building a positive relationship with the idea of _struggle_
- Define _productive struggle_

## Discussion

- What inspired your interest in coding?
- Which, if any, of the examples shared in the previous section spoke to you most?

## Tweets From Experienced Developers

In this next section, we'll dive into the fundamentals of JavaScript. **It will be hard**. That said, it's entirely possible to learn and get better at! It's also 100% ok to not know everything.

Take a moment to look through some tweets from experienced developers, then reflect on the questions below.

Discussion Questions:
- What themes do you notice?
- When was the last time you failed at something? How did you react? What did you do?
- What is something you used to struggle with but now feel comfortable with? What did it take to get where you are now?

## A Developers Mindset

To be a developer, you don't have to remember everything. What's more important is that you're curious, resourceful, communicative, and you're not afraid to question how things work.

At Turing, we frame our thinking (which informs curriculum, instruction, and coaching) around two things that are essential for students to gain the skills they need while at Turing, and be successful on the job:
1. Growth Mindset
2. Productive Struggle
