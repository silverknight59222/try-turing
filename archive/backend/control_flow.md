      <p>Control Flow refers to being able to determine what the program does given certain inputs. It controls the flow of the program!</p>
      <p><span class="vocab">If statements</span> are a type of control flow. An if statement sets up different paths that the program can take depending on what is true at a given moment.</p>

      <h2 class="section-header">Solving Problems Without Knowing Everything</h2>
      <p>As a programmer, you will constantly be solving problems that you don't necessarily know how to solve. This is the fun of coding! Coding involves solving puzzles, guess-and-check, and figuring things out.</p>
      <p>The next Try It section asks you to build something, but we have only taught you about 80% of what you need to know in order to build this! üôÄ This is meant to mimic how projects work at Turing -- we purposefully leave out key pieces of information so that you get practice Googling and reading documentation in order to build a solution.</p>
      <p>Luckily for you, we won't make this <i>too</i> difficult today. The following resources should lead you down the right track:</p>

        <h2>Try it: Control Flow</h2>
        <p>Back on repl.it, create a new repl by clicking the <img style="height: 1.5em" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/images/newrepl.png" alt="New Repl button"> button near the top right corner. Choose the Ruby programming language, and name the repl <code>evenoddcontrolflow</code>.</p>
        <p>Write a program that asks a user for a piece of text. It should say "even" if the number of characters in the text is even, and "odd" if the number of characters in the text is odd.</p>
        <p>This is what the program should look like when it runs.</p>
        <pre>Enter a piece of text:
Turing
Even!</pre>
Try running your program a few times with different inputs.

          <div class="spicy-appear">
            <ol>
              <li>Can you make your program tell the user not only if a word has an even or odd number of characters, but also <b>how many</b> characters they entered? For example, your program would say: <code>Even! (6)</code> or <code>Odd! (3)</code></li>
              <li>üî•This one is extra spicy: Can you make your program only count characters, but ignore spaces? For example, if the user types in <code>chocolate chip cookies are the best</code>, your program should return 30, not 35. It might help to google something like <b>how do you ___________ in Ruby?</b></li>
