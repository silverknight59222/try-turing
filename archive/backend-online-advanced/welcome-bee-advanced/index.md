- Open up <a target="blank" href="https://repl.it/~">repl.it</a> in a browser (preferably Chrome) and create or login to your account
- In another tab, open up <a target="blank" href="https://try.turing.io/backend-online-advanced">try.turing.io/backend-online-advanced</a>
- Change Zoom display name to first name, last initial, pronouns; ie - Amy H. (she/her)

### What to Expect

Over the course of the day, we will write code, start developing some developer habits, and learn a little more about the tech industry.  We will ask you to introduce yourself, ask questions, and occasionally share out answers to the technical work we do! Below is our agenda for the day:

- **12:00 - 12:45** Welcome, Intros, and Setup
- **12:45 - 4:00** Instruction (with breaks!)
- **4:00 - 4:15** Break
- **4:15 - 5:00** Industry Panel

### Learning Norms

- No question is too small. No question is a bad question. Ask them!
- We all benefit from each others ideas! Push yourself to share out and make sure you aren't sharing _so_ much that others don't have the space to do so.

### Online Session Norms

- Mute your mic unless you're talking
- Keep your camera on during class and breakout sessions; ok to turn off during independent work time
- It is very normal in an online setting to accidentally talk over someone. If that happens, apologize and be sure to clarify who is speaking next
- Use features in the Participants Pane to answer yes/no, raise your hand, or give a thumbs up.
- Type questions the group chat box and a staff member will respond. Avoid direct messages unless it is a specific issue only to yourself
- Disconnected? Jump back on! If the host gets disconnected, hold tight, and the session will resume shortly

### Using repl

Today we will be using repl to write and run our code, and view the apps we build! It can be used without an account, but if you want to save any of your work, you'll want to be signed in to an account.

- Create a repl project
- Run/Stop code
- Viewing output
