# Turing Info Session

## Welcome!

We are so glad you are here! To get set up...
1. Please change your Zoom name to first name, last initial, and pronouns, like this: _Kayla G. (she/her)_. Not sure how to do that? Hover over your image in the Zoom gallery, click the three dots, and select Rename.
2. Heads up! We will ask you to briefly introduce yourself in a minute.

## Goals

The goal of this session is to give you a general overview of Turing:
- What we teach and why.
- What it's like to be a Turing student.
- What support we offer for the job hunt.

## Online Learning Norms

- Ask lots of questions! This session is for YOU, so don't hesitate to speak up!
- Mute your microphone unless youâ€™re the main speaker.
- Keep your camera on during class (if possible).
- Disconnected? Jump back on!

## Zoom Tools

Want to get our attention during the workshop? Raise your hand or type your question in the chat! Let's practice:
- **Raise Hand**: Find the reactions button in your Zoom toolbar and raise your hand.
- **Zoom Chat**: Enter your answer in the Zoom chat - How much do you know about Turing, the school? `Absolutely nothing`, `I have a vague idea`, `I know all about it!`, or something else!
- **Unmute**: Introduce yourself! Please share your name, pronouns, location, and what you're hoping to get out of this session.

## Who Is Turing?

Founded in 2014, Turing provides an immersive, intenstive software engineering program where students can go from zero programming knowledge to hirable software developer.

<div class="try-it-new">
    <h2>Turing's Mission Statement</h2>
    <p>To unlock human potential by training a diverse and inclusive student body to succeed in high fulfillment technical careers.</p>
</div>

Turing operates as a non-profit institution which means we answer to students first and are able to focus our energy and resources on excellent instruction and student outcomes. 

At 7-9 months long, our program is longer than most other code schools. This allows us to dig deeper into foundational knowledge so students can build a solid understanding of coding concepts.

We offer career support to all students during the program and after graduation, until they find the right job for them.




## What We Teach

At Turing we have three programs to choose from: Front End, Back End, and Launch.

All three programs are facilitated with a live instructor with live class sessions held over Zoom.

**Front End Program**

Front End engineers work close to the actual user of the software. Many Front End developers have an interest in visual design, but it is not a design discipline.

In this program, students focus on building the "client-side" of applications where code is executed in the browser. 

Front End students will learn:
- How to write HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, leveraging the React framework.
- How to create front end applications that gather data from a user.
- How to talk to other applications (APIs) to send and gather data.
- How to create accessible webpages.

A calendar of our Front End curriculum can be found [here.](https://frontend.turing.edu/today/)

***Program Length and Hours***

- The Front End program is a 7 month program consisting of 4 Modules that are each 6 weeks in length. 
- Live class sessions are held Monday thru Friday from 9 am - 4 pm MST/MDT. 
- Students will complete approximately 13 projects over the course of the program that are often completed outside of the 9-4 instruction time.


**Back End Program**

Back End engineers work closely with the database, handling network requests and organizing data by user needs. 

In this program, students focus on building the "server-side" of applications where code runs on a server and interacts with the database. 

Back End students will learn:
- How to write Ruby, leveraging the Rails framework.
- How to handle network requests and return a network response.
- How to organize and query data within a database.

A calendar of our Back End curriculum can be found [here.](https://backend.turing.edu/additional_resources/calendars)


***Program Length and Hours***

- The Back End program is a 7 month program consisting of 4 Modules that are each 6 weeks in length. 
- Live class sessions are held Monday thru Friday from 9 am - 4 pm MST/MDT. 
- Students will complete approximately 13 projects over the course of the program that are often completed outside of the 9-4 instruction time.


**Launch Program**

The Launch program is geared towards career starters.




## How We Teach

Our teaching model is centered around projects, exploration, and collaboration.

We empower our students to learn the resources they will need to be successful both at Turing and on the job. Although our students do get live instruction on specific topics and concepts, most of their learning is done while working independently from instructors (either solo or with a group) on projects. We have found this approach to learning allows students to internalize a process for finding answers which is exactly what they'll need to do on the job. 

Our live instruction sessions are held live over Zoom during the hours of 9 am - 4 pm MST/MDT, Monday thru Friday. 

We rely heavily on collaboration and teach our students how to work successfully with others both in classes and on projects. There is a lot of group work, sharing of thoughts and ideas, and helping each other both in the live Zoom classes and via Slack when classes are not in session. 

Students are encouraged to take agency over their learning experience while at Turing. We create many opportunities for students to explore topics we don't cover in live instruction. As you might imagine, the world of software development is vast and there is no way we can cover all topics in 7 months (nor will you learn ALL the topics while on the job!).


## Professional Development and Job Hunt Support

In addition to the technical curriculum, our students complete a Professional Development (PD) curriculum as well. 

This PD curriculum starts in Mod 1 and gets students ready for their job search. 

Some topics covered during PD sessions are:
- Resume and Cover Letter building
- Networking
- Building your LinkedIn profile
- Interview skills
- Mock interviews

Our goal with our technical and PD curriculum is that students are prepared to get the job, do the job, and keep the job.

***The Job Hunt***
After successfully completing your Turing program, you will be supported by our New Grad Services (NGS).

NGS offers continued support around helping our grads find their first job by offering:
- continued education workshops
- group projects to work on
- alumni support and mentorship
- continued support around resumes, cover letters, and interviewing skills
