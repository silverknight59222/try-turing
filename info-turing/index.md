# Turing Info Session

## Welcome!

We are so glad you are here! To get set up...
1. Please change your Zoom name to first name, last initial, and pronouns, like this: _Kayla G. (she/her)_. Not sure how to do that? Hover over your image in the Zoom gallery, click the three dots, and select Rename.
2. Heads up! We will ask you to briefly introduce yourself in a minute.

## Goals

The goal of this session is to give you a general overview of Turing:
- what we teach and why
- what it's like to be a student here
- what support we offer for the job hunt

## Online Learning Norms

- Ask lots of questions! This session is for YOU, so don't hesitate to speak up!
- Mute your microphone unless youâ€™re the main speaker.
- Keep your camera on during class (if possible).
- Disconnected? Jump back on!

## Zoom Tools

Want to get our attention during the workshop? Raise your hand or type your question in the chat! Let's practice:
- **Raise Hand**: Find the reactions button in your Zoom toolbar and raise your hand.
- **Zoom Chat**: Enter your answer in the Zoom chat - How much do you know about Turing, the school? `Absolutely nothing`, `I have a vague idea`, `I know all about it!`, or something else!
- **Unmute**: Introduce yourself! Please share your name, pronouns, location, and what you're hoping to get out of this session.

## Who Is Turing?

Founded in 2014, Turing provides an immersive, intenstive software engineering program where students can go from zero programming knowledge to hirable software developer.

<div class="try-it-new">
    <h2>Turing's Mission Statement</h2>
    <p>To unlock human potential by training a diverse and inclusive student body to succeed in high fulfillment technical careers.</p>
</div>

Turing operates as a non-profit institution which means we answer to students first and are able to focus our energy and resources on excellent instruction and student outcomes. 

At 7 months long, our program is longer than most other code schools. This allows us to dig deeper into foundational knowledge so students can build a solid understanding of coding concepts.

We offer career support to all students during the program and after graduation, until they find the right job for them.
