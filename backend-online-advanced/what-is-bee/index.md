# What is Back-End Engineering?

<a href="../">Back to Curriculum Index</a>

## Goals

- Identify the key differences between Front-End and Back-End engineering
- Categorize various technologies used in Back-End engineering

## What is Back-End?

In a broad sense, Back-End engineering is concerned with managing ​data​ (aka information).

If we think about our favorite web applications, what generally makes them special and useful to us is their ability to **do dynamic things**. In most cases, we'd like our website to be able to ​do things -- to record data we tell it to record, store information for us, and be able to retrieve that data later.

Let's consider YouTube. When a user wants to watch a video by a certain creator, what do they do? Most users will enter search criteria in the search bar, select a video, and watch it. While watching, the user is presented with other helpful data, specific to them and their past interactions.

In the screenshot below, the outlines represent examples of **dynamic data** that had to be stored somewhere. That "somewhere" is what Back-End programming is concerned with.

All of the stylistic pieces (layout, colors, sizes), in addition to logic around user interactions, are considered **Front-End** concerns.

When we talk about Back-End programming, we're often thinking of the programming tasks involved in making the following possible:

- Storing data and accessing it later
- Verifying that data is accurate
- Manipulating, analyzing, and/or calculating data
- Making sure data can be retrieved quickly and easily

## Back-End & Front-End

The **Front-End** is the part of the application that users see, touch, and interact with. This is the code that produces the experience in _front_ of the user.

The **Back-End** typically handles stuff like storing information in databases, manipulating that data, verifying users, etc.; it's what happens _behind_ the scenes.

## What technologies are used on the Back-End?

There are numerous technologies that can be used for Back-End programming. Here are a few of them:

- **Languages and frameworks**: Ruby/Rails, Python/Django, Elixir/Phoenix, Java/Spring, and more. A framework is kind of like a set of [Lincoln Logs](https://www.amazon.com/LINCOLN-LOGS-Anniversary-Construction-Education/dp/B00RWNEN9W).
- **Databases**: PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle Database, MongoDB, etc.

We won't be talking about anything except for a teeny tiny part of Ruby. However, we hope that these terms give you a lay of the land so that next time you hear one of these words, you can say "Aha! That's a database."

## What are we doing today?

1. Store data in lists called _Arrays_
2. Randomly select an item from a list
3. Explore ways to store and organize data
