# Wrap-Up

You did it! <span role="img" aria-label="celebration emoji">ðŸŽ‰</span> Thank you so much for spending your evening with us. I hope that thinking about your reason for why you came, you feel like this time was well-spent and you gained some new knowledge, whether that's about code, Turing, or even yourself!

At the beginning of this workshop, we discussed that building the Front-End portion of an application requires HTML, CSS, & JavaScript. We focused on HTML and CSS, but that alone won't be the interactive components of <a target="blank" href="https://js-newbies-checkpoint-3.turingschool.repl.co/">this website</a>. 

<section class="data-type-cards language-cards">
  <div>
    <h3>HTML</h3>
    <p>HTML holds the content we see on a page (text, images) and defines the structure and order in which the content appears.</p>
    <p>We can think of HTML as the skeleton of our webpage; without it, we'd just be a blob:</p>
    <img src="../assets/html.png" alt="Drawing of human skeleton" />
  </div>

  <div>
    <h3>CSS</h3>
    <p>CSS defines the look and feel of a webpage - it can change the size or layout of items on a page, change colors, fonts, and more!</p>
    <p>We can think of CSS as anything that makes us unique and recognizable - our skin, hair, clothes, style, etc.</p>
    <img src="../assets/css.png" alt="Various accessories including a hat, dress, shoes, and hair" />
  </div>

  <div>
    <h3>JavaScript</h3>
    <p>JavaScript is what lets the user interact with a page. For example, clicking a button and getting some sort of response.</p>
    <p>We can think of JavaScript as the brain and muscle of our webpage, as it powers all the action:</p>
    <img src="../assets/js.png" alt="Drawing of a human brain and arm muscle" />
  </div>
</section>
