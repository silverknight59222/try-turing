# Modifying the HTML

## Tour the Existing HTML
- HTML consists of a series of elements, which wrap the content in both an opening and closing tag. 
- The `<div>` tags define a division or a section in an HTML document. These allow us to group important elements together and nest elements to create structure and organization.

### Explore to Learn:
- What line numbers in the HTML file are responsible for the text displayed in the browser?
- What organizational structures do you notice?
- Try commenting out a line of code! Highlight a section of the code and use `cmd + /` or `ctrl + /` to comment out that line. Then click the green `Run` button. What happens? Highlight it again and use the same keyboard shortcut to undo it!
- What might be the purpose of the `class` that appears on some of the elements?

  <p>Now that we're getting to know HTML and this specific project a bit better, let's modify it!</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Add two more single cards, each with a card title and card text.</li>
    <li>Decide what content you would like for your webpage. If you're not feeling creative, make it a glossary of terms we are learning today!</li>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>CSS:</strong> Short for Cascading Style Sheets, this language controls the look and feel of a webpage. It can change the layout of items on a page, colors, fonts, and even animate elements!</li>
      <li><strong>JavaScript:</strong> This programming language is responsible for user interaction. For example, when the user clicks a button and sees a change in the browser, this action is controlled by JavaScript.</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>

## HTML Summary

- We can nest elements inside of other elements to create structure within the HTML.
- Classes allow us to give each element a specific label so that we can reference that element later.
- The number of elements and the content inside of the elements in the HTML file usually have a 1-to-1 correlation with what we see in the browser.
