<!-- ### BIPOC Scholarship
Turing is committed to building a more diverse and inclusive tech community. We award scholarships to students who demonstrate a desire to authentically influence the tech industry, financial need, and personal background. Students from historically excluded and underrepresented communities -- Black, Indigenous, or People of Color (BIPOC) -- are encouraged to apply.

### Inclusion Scholarship
We work hard to build a culture of belonging at Turing where everyone is respected, appreciated, and valued. The Inclusion Scholarship is awarded to individuals who demonstrate a desire to increase inclusive practices in the tech industry, financial need, and personal background. We encourage students from all backgrounds to apply. -->
