# Wrap-Up

Wow! You learned a lot today. Today might have been your very first time coding. Give yourself a well-deserved pat on the back. You did it! ðŸŽ‰ Thanks for spending your time with us.

## Tomorrow

In tomorrowâ€™s session, we will deep dive into the foundations of Front End development! We will build a very similar project, but this time, youâ€™ll have a web application for your user to see, touch, and interact with. You will identify some big differences between our work today, as well as many similarities!

If you are unable to join us tomorrow, <strong>please share about your experience, and how we can best support you moving forward, by completing <a target="blank" href="https://forms.gle/VJB9gkJzFEWerpZS8">this short survey</a>.</strong>

## Additional Resources

- Learn more about the difference between Front End and Back End, and what you will learn and build at Turing by checking out [the program progression](../../what-students-learn).
- <a target="blank" href="https://www.codeacademy.com/learn/learn-ruby">Codecademyâ€™s Ruby course</a> is free and interactive. Youâ€™ll know immediately if your code is working as expected.
- <a target="blank" href="https://pine.fm/learntoprogram/">Chris Pineâ€™s Ruby Book</a> is a another free online resource! This is especially helpful if you learn well by reading.
