# Extension Challenge

Congratulations on finishing a crash course in Ruby programming! The learning doesn’t have to stop here.

## Goals

- Understand that there is more than one way to solve a problem using code
- Collaborate with over developers to make sense of unfamiliar code
- Use technical vocabulary to accurately describe what code is doing

## Many Tools, Same Outcome
There are many ways to accomplish the same goal using code. You can think of all of these Ruby methods and expressions as tools in your toolkit. It’s up to you as the developer to decide which tool you’d like to use for the job. Some tools may be more efficient than others, but many tools can be used to achieve the same outcome. For this extension challenge, we are going to take a look at other ways we could have written our program and try to make sense of them.
