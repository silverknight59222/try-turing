# JavaScript Basics

JavaScript is the part of the code that controls user interaction. It allows the user to actually <em>do</em> something on the site. The user can click buttons or type information in a form and they usually get some form of visual feedback on the screen that they did something. Before we dive into making interactive components, letâ€™s discuss some JavaScript basics.

## Data Types

There are different types of data or information that we need to keep track of when we are building our application. The most common are strings and numbers. A string is a string of characters enclosed in quotation marks. A number is a whole number with no quotation marks. We can even perform operations with number values.

```js
'I am a string!'

"I can hold emojis: ðŸ’¥ðŸ¦„âœ¨, lots of spaces:     , and special characters: $#@%"

4 + 2
//=> 6

7 * 3
//=> 21
```

## Variables

Variables allow us to store information in a container with a label. We can then use that label to reference the contents of that container. 

In JavaScript, we declare variables using the `var` keyword. This tells JavaScript that we're about to make a new variable, or _declare a variable_. Here are a few examples of JavaScript variables:

```js
var age = 104;
var school = 'Turing School of Software & Design';
var firstName = 'Kaitlyn';
```

## console.log()

As we learn about JavaScript today, we will use the `console.log()` method to print the data we are working with out to the console in replit. Here's the syntax:

```js
console.log(firstName);
//=> 'Kaitlyn'
console.log(age);
//=> 104
```

<div class="try-it-new">
  <h2>Variables</h2>
  <p>Fork <a href="https://replit.com/@turingschool/quiz-playground#script.js" target="blank">this replit</a> and follow the directions to play around with variables and data types. We will only be working through exercises 1 and 2 on the JavaScript file. Use the previous examples to help you get started.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Declare 3 variables, using the labels name, adjective, and yearsAsFriends. Assign each to an appropriate value.</li>
    <li>Make sure to <code>console.log()</code> each variable to verify you've stored it correctly!</li>
  </ul>
</div>

## Objects

All of those variables we declared earlier are referring to one single friend or one single object. In JavaScript (and many other programming languages), we have a way to store all of those related attributes in one variable called an object. The syntax for a JavaScript object looks like this: 

```js
var friend = {
  name : "Ashley",
  adjective : "funny",
  yearsAsFriends : 8
}
```

Each line in the object is called a `property` that consists of a key-value pair. The `key` is on the left and the `value` assigned to that key is on the right. To reference one value in the object, we use `dot notation`, by referencing the name of the object followed by a `.` and the key for the value we want to access. Here's an example:

```js
console.log(friend.name);
//=> 'Ashley'
console.log(friend.yearsAsFriends);
//=> 8
```

<div class="try-it-new">
  <h2>Objects</h2>
  <p>Back in your same playground replit, complete exercises 3 and 4 in the JavaScript file.  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Create an object that stores all of the properties that describe your friend in one variable.</li>
    <li>Use <code>console.log()</code> and dot notation to print each value to the console.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

## Arrays

Another data type is an array, which is just a collection of items that belong together. For example, we could have an array of strings, one for the name of each student in a class. 

```js
var students = ['Zanna', 'Ranita', 'Samuel', 'Zachary', 'Anhnhi', 'Marianne'];
```

If we just want to access one element from an array, we can use `bracket notation` and a number that corresponds with that element. As weird as it may seem, [counting starts with 0 in most programming languages.](https://skillcrush.com/blog/why-programmers-start-counting-at-zero/)

```js
console.log(students[0]);
//=> 'Zanna'

console.log(students[5]);
//=> 'Marianne'
```

<div class="try-it-new">
  <h2>Arrays</h2>
  <p>In the same playground replit, complete exercises 5 and 6 in the JavaScript file.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Create an array called friendsArray of three friends' names.</li>
    <li>Use bracket notation to print the first and third friends' names to the console.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

## Putting It All Together

We can combine these data structures to store our data in more complex ways. For example, we could have an `array` of `objects`. That would look something like this:

```js
var students = [
  {
    name : "Zanna",
    location : "Texas"
  },
  {
    name : "Zachary",
    location : "Colorado"
  }
]
```

If we want to access one element from an array and then one property from that object, we can use `bracket notation` and `dot notation` to get that specfic value.

```js
console.log(students[0].location);
//=> 'Texas'

console.log(students[1].name);
//=> 'Zachary'
```

<div class="try-it-new">
  <h2>Arrays of Objects</h2>
  <p>In the same playground replit, complete exercises 7, 8 and 9 in the JavaScript file.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Create a friends array of three objects, each object representing a friend with the same three properties (name, adjective, and yearsAsFriends).</li>
    <li>Use bracket notation and dot notation to print the second friend's adjective to the console.</li>
    <li>Use bracket notation and dot notation to print the third friend's name to the console.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

## String Interpolation

We can use string interpolation to combine static data with dynamic (or variable) data. Hereâ€™s an example of the syntax:

```javascript
console.log(`Hello, ${students[1].name}!`);
//=> 'Hello, Zachary!'
```

Note that back ticks are the characters that surround this combination of the string and ${} syntax. You can find the back-tick key at the top-left of your keyboard, next to the 1.

Anything inside the back ticks will be read as a string. But, when the interpreter sees the ${, it will stop and wait for JavaScript code to read. Typically, we provide a variable name here. When the interpreter read the matching closing bracket - } - it goes back to treating characters as part of the string.

<div class="try-it-new">
  <h2>String Interpolation</h2>
  <p>In the same playground replit, complete exercise 10 in the JavaScript file.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Use string interpolation to print a complete sentence describing your first friend in the array.</li>
    <li><strong>Finished?</strong> Try it for another friend!</li>
  </ul>
</div>

  <ul>
    <li>Under step 1 at the top of this file, you will see some variables defined for you.</li>
    <li>In your questions variable, we have an array of question objects.</li>
    <li>Replace each empty string with the values you want for your questions.</li>

  <p>At this point, your project should look something <a href="https://replit.com/@turingschool/quiz-app-checkpoint-2#script.js" target="blank">like this</a>.</p>

## JavaScript Summary

- Variables allow us to store information in a container with a label.
- Arrays are a collection of items that belong together.
- Objects store multiple properties related to one single object.
- Reminder: This stuff gets really complex! We are only scratching the surface with some foundational topics today.
