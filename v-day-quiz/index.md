# Valentine's Day Pop-Up

In this live, instructor-led workshop, you will build an interactive webpage with interactive buttons that hide and reveal information. 

_This will be best experienced on a desktop or laptop computer._

## Welcome!

We are so glad you are here! To get set up...
1. Open up <a target="blank" href="https://replit.com/~">repl.it</a> in a browser (preferably Chrome) and log in to your account.
1. Please change your zoom name to first, last initial, pronouns, like this: _Amy H. (she/her)_. To do this, hover over your image on zoom, click the three dots and select “Rename” from the menu.
1. Heads up! We will ask you to briefly introduce yourself in a few minutes.

## Goals

- Build and customize an <a target="blank" href="https://v-day-newlyweds-final.kaitlyn-vg.repl.co/">interactive quiz based on the Newlyweds Game</a>
- Feel free to get creative with this template and do something <a href="https://v-day-game-final.kaitlyn-vg.repl.co/" target="blank">a little different</a>, if you want!
- Gain _exposure_ and familiarity with some HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Determine if coding is something you enjoy doing and want to pursue further

Disclaimer: We won't become experts in these languages today. And you may leave with more questions than answers!

## Zoom Tools and Introductions

- Reactions - Raise your hand if a friend or family member recommended Turing to you!
- Chat - Would you rather cuddle with a cat or a dog?
- Intros - name, pronouns, location, why you are here!

Want to get my attention during the workshop? Raise your hand, type your question in the chat, or just come off mute and ask!

## Online Learning Norms

- Ask your questions and share your code!
- Mute your microphone unless you’re the main speaker.
- Keep your camera on during class.

## What is Front End Engineering?

Building the user-facing part of a website or app is referred to as Front End Engineering. Building the Front End of a web page requires writing code in three programming languages, and making the code in each language “talk to” the code in the others.

It can feel like a lot, but let’s start by building an understanding of what each language is responsible for. We will make some comparisons to the human body to create context.

<section class="data-type-cards language-cards">
  <div>
    <h3>HTML</h3>
    <p>HTML holds the content we see on a page (text, images) and defines the structure and order in which the content appears.</p>
    <p>We can think of HTML as the skeleton of our webpage; without it, we'd just be a blob:</p>
    <img src="./assets/html.png" alt="Drawing of human skeleton" />
  </div>

  <div>
    <h3>CSS</h3>
    <p>CSS defines the look and feel of a webpage - it can change the size or layout of items on a page, change colors, fonts, and more!</p>
    <p>We can think of CSS as anything that makes us unique and recognizable - our skin, hair, clothes, style, etc.</p>
    <img src="./assets/css.png" alt="Various accessories including a hat, dress, shoes, and hair" />
  </div>

  <div>
    <h3>JavaScript</h3>
    <p>JavaScript is what lets the user interact with a page. For example, clicking a button and getting some sort of response.</p>
    <p>We can think of JavaScript as the brain and muscle of our webpage, as it powers all the action:</p>
    <img src="./assets/js.png" alt="Drawing of a human brain and arm muscle" />
  </div>
</section>

## Warm-Up
This might be your very first day working with code. Learning is often uncomfortable and things are bound to break. Let's practice working through some common errors together.

<div class="expander expander-lesson">
  <header>
    <h3 class="spicy-click">My code is broken! What do I do?!</h3>
    <div><button class="expander-btn"><img src="../../assets/icons/arrow.svg" alt="expander arrow icon" /></button></div>
  </header>
  <div class="hide">
    <p>Fork <a target="blank" href="https://replit.com/@turingschool/find-the-error#index.html">this replit</a> and see if you can spot the <strong>one mistake</strong> in each file.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Don't panic. There are some things that will break often. Check those first.</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Did you spell everything correctly?</li>
          <li>Do you have closing symbols for every block or element?</li>
          <li>Do the colors follow a predictable pattern?</li>
        </ul>
      <li>To avoid breaking lots of things all at once, use the green <code>Run</code> button after every change you make!</li>
      <li>Ask for help!</li>
    </ol>
  </div>
</div>
