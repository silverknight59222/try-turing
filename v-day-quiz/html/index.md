# Modifying the HTML

## Tour the Existing HTML

- Information between the `<head>` tags does not show in the browser. It is only background information for the webpage.
- Elements that live inside of the `<body>` tags will be displayed on the page (lines 13-33).
- The `<div>` tags define a division or a section in an HTML document. These allow us to group important elements together and nest elements to create structure and organization.

### Explore to Learn:
- How many different tags do you see between lines 13 and 33?
- What organizational structures do you notice?
- What might be the purpose of the `id` on elements?
- Try commenting out a line of code using `cmd + /` and then click the green `Run` button. What happens? Use the same keyboard shortcut to undo it!

  <p>Now that we're getting to know HTML and this specific project a bit better, let's modify it! Currently, we don't have a question or options showing up on the screen. Let's fix that.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>On line 16, change the description of your quiz game.</li>
    <li>On line 19, give your question a title (Question 1).</li>
    <li>On line 20, write your first question for your quiz.</li>
    <li>On lines 22-23, fill in two answer choices for your question between the button tags.</li>
    <li>On line 25, put some placeholder text like, "Feedback will go here."</li>
  </ul>
</div>

## HTML Summary

- Elements that live inside of the `body` tags will be displayed on the page
- We can nest elements inside of other elements to create structure within the HTML
- Classes and IDs allow us to give each element a specific label so that we can reference that element later
- The number of elements and the content inside of the elements in the HTML file usually have a 1-to-1 correlation with what we see in the browser
