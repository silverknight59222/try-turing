# Modifying the HTML

Throughout the lesson today, we will be using this <a href="https://replit.com/@turingschool/quiz-playground#script.js" target="blank">playground replit</a> to learn and take notes before implementing that learning into our final project. Go ahead and `fork` or make a copy of this replit and navigate to the HTML file. Then, click the green `Run` button to see the browser output or what the user will actually see!

## Explore to Learn:
Look at the `index.html` file. 
- What elements do you see between the `body` tags?
- What might be the purpose of the `id` on elements?
- Try commenting out a line of code by placing your cursor at the front of the line and hold down `cmd + /`. Then, click the green `Run` button. What happens? Use the same keyboard shortcut to undo it!
- Go ahead and add in placeholder text between each opening and closing tag for the `<h2>` and `<p>` elements. Click the green `Run` button to see your text appear in the browser!

## Tour the Existing HTML in Your Project
Use this <a href="https://replit.com/@turingschool/quiz-app-starter-kit#script.js" target="blank">starter kit</a> to create the foundation for your quiz project. Remember to `fork` this replit to create your own copy!
- Information between the `<head>` tags does not show in the browser. It is only background information for the webpage.
- Elements that live inside of the `<body>` tags will be displayed on the page (lines 13-32).
- The `<div>` tags define a division or a section in an HTML document. These allow us to group important elements together and nest elements to create structure and organization.

### Explore to Learn:
- How many different tags do you see between lines 13 and 32?
- What organizational structures do you notice?

  <h2>Modify the Project Code</h2>
  <p>Now that we're getting to know HTML and this specific project a bit better, let's modify it! Currently, we have a bunch of HTML elements with no text between the tags. Let's fix that by adding in some placeholders, so that we can get a better idea of our final project.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>On line 16, change the description of your quiz game.</li>
    <li>On line 19, write a question placeholder.</li>
    <li>On lines 21-22, fill in two answer choice placeholders for your question between the button tags.</li>
    <li>On line 24, put some placeholder text like, "Feedback will go here."</li>
    <li>On line 28, show the user the current score.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Click the green Run button to see your changes in the browswer. At this point, your project should look something <a href="https://replit.com/@turingschool/quiz-app-checkpoint-1#index.html" target="blank">like this</a>.</p>
</div>

## HTML Summary

- Elements that live inside of the `body` tags will be displayed on the page.
- We can nest elements inside of other elements to create structure within the HTML.
- Classes and ids allow us to give each element a specific label so that we can reference that element later.
- The number of elements and the content inside of the elements in the HTML file usually have a 1-to-1 correlation with what we see in the browser.
