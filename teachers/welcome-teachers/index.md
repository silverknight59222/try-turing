# Welcome to Try Coding for Teachers

### To Get Set Up

- In Chrome, open up <a target="blank" href="https://try.turing.io/teachers">try.turing.io/teachers</a>
- Open up <a href="https://repl.it/~" target="blank">repl.it</a> and login to your account
- Change Zoom display name to first name, last initial, pronouns; ie - Amy H. (she/her)

### What to Expect

Over the course of the day, we will write code while making connections to real apps we use and learn a little more about the tech industry and what the career change from education may look like.  We will ask you to introduce yourself, ask questions, and occasionally share out answers to the technical work we do! 

Below is our agenda for each day:

- **10:00 - 12:30** Welcome, Intros, and Instruction
- **12:30 - 1:15** Educators-turned-Developers Panel
- **1:15 - 1:45** Late Lunch Break
- **1:45 - 3:45**  Instruction
- **3:45 - 4:00**  Wrap Up, Questions

### Learning Norms

- No question is too small. No question is a bad question. Ask them!
- We all benefit from each others ideas! Push yourself to share out and make sure you aren't sharing _so_ much that others don't have the space to do so.

### Online Session Norms

- Mute your mic unless you're talking
- It is very normal in an online setting to accidentally talk over someone. If that happens, apologize and be sure to clarify who is speaking next
- Keep your camera on during class and breakout sessions; ok to turn off during independent work time
- Use features in the Participants Pane to answer yes/no, raise your hand, or give a thumbs up.
- You might be sharing your screen today - if you have anything open that you don't want to accidentally share, close or minimize it now
- Type questions the group chat box and a TA will answer you. Avoid direct messages to a TA unless it is a specific issue only to yourself
- Disconnected? Jump back on! If the host or TAs get disconnected, hold tight, and the session will resume shortly

### Intros

- Name, pronouns
- What do you teach?
- What brought you here today?

### Tools

Our main tool with be repl.it. We will write and run our code there today. Please opne it up in the browser andmake sure you are logged in. Repl.it works best in Chrome!
