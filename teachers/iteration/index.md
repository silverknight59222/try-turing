# Iteration

<a href="../">Back to Curriculum Index</a>

## Goals

- Use Ruby syntax to iterate over arrays
- Filter through an array, given specific criteria

## Iteration 

**Iteration** is defined as _the repetition of a process_. We see iteration in the physical world all the time. Let's think about the process of grading papers:
- You have a **collection** of papers
- For **each** paper...
  - We read through it, mark score on top, record in gradebook
- Then, repeat with next paper. Continue until all papers are graded

In programming, we follow a similar cadence. Let's think about all those promotional emails we wake up to every morning:
- The app has a long **list** of email addresses in it's database
- For **each** email address...
  - The app sends an email off to that address at 5:30am
- Then, repeat with next email address. Continue until all email addresses have been used

## Syntax for Iteration

To write code that iterates over an array, we will follow the cadence we saw in the examples above:
- Start with a **collection** (Array)
- Identify **each** element
- **Do** something with/to it
- Repeat until all elements have been worked with

[Let's walk through](https://repl.it/@ameseee/each-intro#main.rb) what each piece of the code below is doing:

```ruby
numbers = [2, 5, 9, 5]

numbers.each do |number|
  puts number * 2
end
```

Here's an example with strings:

```ruby
courses_offered = ["Math", "Science", "ELA", "Theater"]

courses_offered.each do |course|
  puts "Welcome to #{course}!"
end

print "courses_offered array is unchanged: #{courses_offered}"
```

Using `each` in the way we are above, we will not mutate, or change, the original array!

<div class="try-it-new">
  <h2>Try It: Iteration</h2>
  <p>Using the <code class="try-it-code">each</code> method, iterate over your array of student names and print out a personalized message for each student.</p>
</div>

## A More Advanced Method

Sometimes, we don't want to perform the exact same action on every element in an array. Let's think about the favoriting feature on Kahoot:
- A user can "favorite" a kahoot
- A user can view all kahoots
- A user can click a button to view favorited kahoots _only_

How did the program sift through all the elements in the `kahoots` array and know to only show some? Again, since Ruby is _such_ a friendly language, it gives us a method called `select` that does the heavy lifting for us.

[Let's take a look](https://repl.it/@ameseee/select-intro) at the syntax:

```ruby
numbers = [2, 5, 9, 5]

small_numbers = numbers.select do |number|
  number < 7
end

puts small_numbers
```

<div class="try-it-new">
  <h2>Try It: Select</h2>
  <p>Using the <code class="try-it-code">select</code> method, iterate over your array of student names select only the names that are longer than 4 characters.</p>
  <div class="help-container">
    <button class="help-click">ðŸ¤šHelp Me!</button>
    <div class="help-toggle">
      <pre>students = ["Allie", "Ruby", "Lisa", "Maile", "Kai"]

long_names = students.select do |student|
  student.length > 4
end

puts long_names</pre>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="spicy-container">
    <p class="spicy-click">Click here for an Early Finisher Challenge!</p>
    <div class="spicy-toggle">
      <p>Using the same methods and syntax as the initial challenge, write code that will create an array of all the names from your original array that start with the letter "A".</p>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

### How Useful Is This?

While we've gotten into some really interesting and intermediate programming concepts, it still may be hard to see the utility in this. Names alone aren't enough. As educators, you may want to quickly determine the list of names of students who won't have their permission slip signed, or who scored below a 70 on last Friday's quiz, etc. You probably need the name of a student who meet _some other_ criteria. That is what we dive into in the next section!
