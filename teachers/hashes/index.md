# Hashes

<a href="../">Back to Curriculum Index</a>

## Goals

- Use Ruby syntax to declare variables that store Hashes
- Explain use cases for Hashes
- Access elements by key
- Create and work with more robust student lists

## Hashes

- overview, why, diff bt array
- Syntax

TRY IT:
might want to start a new repl for this.
declare a variable that stores a hash. It should be called `student1` and store 4-5 pieces of information about any student (can be made up!).
print it out.

## Access elements

TRY it:
 print out each individual value assoc with student1

## Nested Collections

- create an array called all_students
- each element should be a hash that follows the setup for the student1 hash you built earlier.

- print the array out to make sure you don't have any errors

## Iterating over an Array of Hashes
