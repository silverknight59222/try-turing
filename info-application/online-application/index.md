# Part 1: Online Application

Your first step for applying to be a Turing student is to complete the online application at <a target="blank" href="https://apply.turing.edu/">apply.turing.edu</a>. The online application has three parts:

## Basic Info

Your name, email, phone number, etc. The basics.

## More About You

Tell us your story! We want to understand what you've done in your past. There are no must-have items here. We've had students come to Turing straight out of high school, others with college degrees and some with decades of work experience. 

You will have the choice to upload a resume or answer a few questions.

## Logic Puzzles

This portion consists of eight questions that will help give us an idea of how you approach problems. The questions are modeled after LSAT logic games. You must get at least 5 answers correct to move onto the next round in the application process. 

### Logic Puzzle Example

**Set up:** At school, six students, Jeremy, Luis, Marissa, Sam, Nico, and Denise, are assigned seats. There are six seats numbered 1 to 6 from left to right. Sam is not in either the leftmost or rightmost seat. There are exactly two students between Nico and Denise. Luis and Sam are next to each other. Marissa is in seat three.

**Question:** If Jeremy is next to Denise, which of the following cannot be true:
- A. Sam is next to Nico.
- B. Marissa is next to Jeremy.
- C. Jeremy is in seat two.
- D. Denise is in seat four.
- E. Nico is in seat four.

### Logic Puzzle Tips

- We highly recommend getting in some practice on the logic puzzles before you start your application. The internet has tons of practice! Try googling "LSAT logic games examples" or start <a target="blank" href="https://www.varsitytutors.com/lsat_logic_games-practice-tests">here</a>.
- Don't rush! How long you take on the quiz isn't nearly as important as getting the right answer. Our recommendation is to slow down to carefully get through those questions.
- It's hard to keep all of this information in your head. Write it down! <a target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7mUPexyLZE">Here's an example of how you might diagram a logic puzzle</a>. 
- Use the process of elimination if you get stuck. All questions will be multiple choice. Remember - one of those choices is the right answer. Go through them one by one and find it!
- When in doubt, talk it out. In software development, we call this process <a target="blank" href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/rubber-duck-debugging/">rubber ducking</a>. If you talk through your problem out loud (even if no one is listening), you're likely to get un-stuck!
- Give your brain some breaks! There's often pressure to just think harder and push through when you're stuck, but that's not a great strategy. Our brains need breaks! When you hit a blocker, take a minute or two away from your screen. Pet your dog! Touch a tree! Drink some water! You'll be amazed at what light bulbs will go off when you come back.
