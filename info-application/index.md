2. Heads up! We will ask you to briefly introduce yourself in a minute.

## Goals

- Answer questions you have or get you connected with someone who can answer your questions

## Online Learning Norms

Want to get our attention during the workshop? Raise your hand, type your question in the chat, or come off mute and ask!
- **Raise Hand**: Find the reactions button in your zoom toolbar and raise your hand.
- **Zoom Chat**: Where are you in your Turing application process? `Haven't started`, `Actively applying now`, `About to interview`, or something else!
