# Turing Application Overview

## At a Glance

First, thanks so much for being here and showing interest in our program! We are so excited to get to know you better. We hope that this session sets you up for success so that we can get to know YOU through your application process. 

Our application process requires **zero** technical experience - we'll teach you everything technical that you need to know once you're a student here ðŸ˜„ The application is set up so that we can evaluate:
- Your desire to enter into the field of software development
- Your excitement for working with others
- Your ability to work through logical challenges 
- Why you feel that Turing is the best path for you into this industry

If you are not accepted (at any stage in the process), you can reapply in 45 days.

## Applicant Requirements
In order to join us at Turing School, students must:
- Be at least 18 years of age when classes begin.
- Have a high school diploma, GED, or equivalent when classes begin.
- Be no more than +/- two time zones away from US Mountain Time (MST/MDT)  
  - Classes are held every weekday from 9 am to 4 pm MST/MDT via Zoom
  - Over 50% of projects are collaborative, with students regularly working sychronously outside of the 9-4 classtime

## The Process

There are two parts to the Turing application:
- Online Application
- Live Interview (via Zoom)

We will walk through each of those pieces in detail in this session.
