# Wrap Up

THANK YOU for joining us today and all your hard work! You did it <span role="img" aria-label="celebration emoji">ðŸŽ‰</span>

## Next Steps

Are you in love with coding? Here are some next steps you may want to take:
- [Set up a time to meet with Chelsea](https://go.oncehub.com/ChelseaTuring) about what that could look like for you at Turing _or_ send her an email at **chelsea@turing.io**.
- [Start your application](https://apply.turing.edu/) to join us as a full-time student

Want to do a little more exploration before taking the next step toward a career change? Here are some great places to start:
- Attend a Try Coding Weekend workshop where you'll go a bit more in depth as to how things work in a given language, and explore the difference between Front-End and Back-End Engineering
- Get more exposure and gain comfort with the syntax by working through one of [Codecademy's free tutorials](https://www.codecademy.com/)
