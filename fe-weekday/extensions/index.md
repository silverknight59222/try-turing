# Extensions

Applying the same concepts, work to implement one final feature.

<div class="try-it-new">
  <h2>Final Feature</h2>
  <p>When the user clicks the "Start Over" button, a new number should be created and the feedback text should be hidden or cleared out.</p>
</div>

We won't give you any hints for this one; but if you are stuck or just wanting to check your solution, [you can find one at the bottom of this CodePen](https://codepen.io/turing-trycoding/pen/abBpgNg?editors=1010). Keep in mind that there it's very possible two developers write different solutions, but both work. There isn't a right or wrong, as long as it gets the job done!
