# Modifying the Lite-Brite HTML

## Tour the Existing Code

- Elements that live inside of the `body` tags will be displayed on the page (lines 11-27)

### Explore to Learn:

- Look at the browser - how many Lite-Brite "dots" are being displayed? Can you identify the code that created those dots?
- While your cursor is on line 20, use the keyboard shortcut `cmd + /` (Mac) or `ctrl + /` (PC) to _comment out_ that line of code. Re-run the project. What changes do you see in the browser? What does that teach you about what line 20 does? (When finished exploring, _uncomment_ line 20 with the same shortcut.)

<div class="try-it-new">
  <h2>Modify the Existing Code</h2>
  <p>Now that we're getting to know HTML and this specific project a bit better, let's modify it!</p>
  <p><strong>Add 5-10 additional dots to your Lite-Brite board.</strong></p>
  <p><em>Your dots are giant, probably bigger than desired. We will learn how to change their size in the next section!</em></p>

## HTML Summary

- Elements that live inside of the `body` tags will be displayed on the page
- The number of elements and the content inside of the elements in the HTML file usually have a 1-1 correlation with what we see in the browser
- Every little character matters - the browser can't assume anything about what we want it to do
