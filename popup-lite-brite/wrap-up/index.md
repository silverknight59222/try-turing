## Next Steps
Are you in love with coding? Here are some next steps you may want to take:
- [Set up a time to meet with Launa](https://go.oncehub.com/LaunaGardner1) about what that could look like for you at Turing _or_ send her an email at **launa@turing.edu**.
- [Start your application](https://apply.turing.edu/) to join us as a full-time student.

Want to do a little more exploration before taking the next step toward a career change? Here are some great places to start:
- Attend another <a target="blank" href="https://turing.edu/try-coding">Try Coding</a> workshop.
- Get more exposure and gain comfort with the syntax by working through one of [Codecademy's free tutorials](https://www.codecademy.com/).
