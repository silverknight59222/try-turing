# Pop Up: Build a Virtual Lite-Brite

[Thinking of a Lite-Brite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lite-Brite) may make you nostalgic. But these days, they are covered in germs. In this live, instructor-led workshop, you will build and customize your very own _virtual_ Lite Brite that you can share with anyone around the world!

_This will be best experienced on a desktop or laptop computer._

## Welcome!

We are so glad you are here! To get set up...
1. Open up <a target="blank" href="http://repl.it/">repl.it</a> in a browser (preferably Chrome) and log in to your account
1. Please change your zoom name to first, last initial, pronouns (ex: _Amy H. (she/her)_)
1. Introduce yourself in the zoom chat - where are you calling in from?
<br><br>

## Goals

- Build and customize a virtual Lite-Brite
- Gain _exposure_ and familiarity with some HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Determine if coding is something you enjoy doing and want to pursue further

Disclaimer: We won't become experts in these languages today. And you may leave with more questions than answers!

## Programming Languages We Will Use

Building the user-facing part of a website or app is referred to as Front-End Engineering. Building a Front-End requires the writing code in three programming languages, and making the code in each language "talk to" the code in the others.

It can feel like a lot, but let's start by building an understanding of what each language is responsible for. We will make some comparisons to the human body to create context.

<section class="data-type-cards language-cards">
  <div>
    <h3>HTML</h3>
    <p>HTML holds the content we see on a page (text, images) and defines the structure and order in which the content appears.</p>
    <p>We can think of HTML as the skeleton of our webpage; without it, we'd just be a blob:</p>
    <img src="./assets/html.png" alt="Drawing of human skeleton" />
  </div>

  <div>
    <h3>CSS</h3>
    <p>CSS defines the look and feel of a webpage - it can change the size or layout of items on a page, change colors, fonts, and more!</p>
    <p>We can think of CSS as anything that makes us unique and recognizable - our skin, hair, clothes, style, etc.</p>
    <img src="./assets/css.png" alt="Drawing of human skeleton" />
  </div>

  <div>
    <h3>JavaScript</h3>
    <p>JavaScript is what lets the user interact with a page. For example, clicking a button and getting some sort of response.</p>
    <p>We can think of JavaScript as the brain and muscle of our webpage, as it powers all the action:</p>
    <img src="./assets/js.png" alt="Drawing of human skeleton" />
  </div>
</section>

Let's explore [this small project](https://repl.it/@turingschool/html-css-js-breakdown#index.html) to see what this looks like in code.
<br><br>

## Project Setup

We will work off of a starter kit that has already been created. Click [this link to access the starter kit](https://repl.it/@turingschool/LiteBrite1#index.html) in repl.it. Here's how to get set up:
1. Once you are on the site, substitute your name in for the `NAME` placeholder on line 5 of the HTML file.
1. Click the green "Run" button at the top of the page, and you should see a mini Lite-Brite project on the right side of the page.

## Now, it gets even more fun:
- [HTML - Content](./html)
- [CSS - Styles](./css)
- [JavaScript- Explore](./js-1)
- [JavaScript - Create](./js-2)
- [Extensions](./extensions)
- [Wrap Up](./wrap-up)
