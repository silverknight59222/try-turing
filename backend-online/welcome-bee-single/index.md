# Welcome to Try Coding!

### To Get Set Up

- Please sign in here: <a target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/3949emq"> http://bit.ly/3949emq</a>
- Open up <a target="blank" href="https://repl.it/~">repl.it</a> in a browser (preferably Chrome) and login to your account
- In another tab, open up <a target="blank" href="https://try.turing.io/">try.turing.io</a>
- Make sure you have a fully charged computer (or can plug in to a charger when necessary)

### Online Session Protocol

- Keep your camera on during class and breakout sessions; ok to turn off during independent work time
- Mute yourself **unless** you're talking.
- Change Zoom display name to first name, last initial, pronouns; ie - Rachel W. (she/her)
- We recommend using headphones and finding a quiet work space to limit distractions. However, we also understand that things come up! 
- You might be sharing your screen with your team at some point during the class -- if you have anything open that you don't want to accidentally share, close or minimize it now.
- Questions? Type into the group chat box and a TA will answer you. Avoid direct messages to a TA unless it is a specific issue only to yourself. 
- Disconnected? Jump back on! If the host or TAs get disconnected, hold tight, and the session will resume shortly. 

### What to Expect

Over the course of the day, we will write code, explore the mindsets that successful developers have, and learn a little more about Turing.  We will ask you to introduce yourself, ask questions, and occasionally share out answers to the technical work we do! Below is our agenda for the day:

- **10:00 - 11:45** Welcome, Intros, and Instruction
- **11:45 - 12:00** Break
- **12:00 - 12:45** Student/Alum Panel, Turing Info
- **12:45 - 2:15**  Instruction
- **2:15  - 2:30**  Wrap Up

### Zoom Practice!

- Use the chat box to introduce yourself: 1) Where are you from? 2) Why did you decide to spend your weekend learning to code? 3) Optional: share something else about yourself. 
- Raise your Zoom hand if you want to tell us your favorite or least favorite thing about being stuck inside
- Thumbs up in the camera
- Breakout rooms: in a web browser tab, pull up a photo of a really cute animal :) Be ready to practice sharing your screen in your breakout room.
