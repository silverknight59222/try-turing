# Final Challenge

Now that we've learned about until loops, if/else statements, integers, strings, and variables, we're ready to write our first program that brings it all together! (And let's be honest, probably the only thing your friends will think is somewhat cool from today).

We'll do this challenge all together, and we'll start by writing pseudocode to fully understand all of the discrete pieces.

Pseudocode is an English-like version of code that will help us define all of the individual steps that need to happen in order to play the number guessing game. We'll act it out as humans, pausing to jot down everything that needs to happen.

Here are the specifications:

<div class="try-it-new">
  <h2>Try It: Guess the Number</h2>
  <p>Use what you know about while loops and if/else statements to write a program that sets a secret number, then allows a user to guess. If the number is too high, print "Too high!" and prompt the user to guess again. If the number is too low, print "Too low!" and prompt the user to guess again. If the number guessed is the secret number, then print "Correct!" and exit the game.</p>
  <p>Important: <code class="try-it-code">gets</code> stands for "get string". This means that even if the user enters a number, like 9, the computer reads it as "9" (which is not the same as 9). </p>
  <pre>Guess a number.
5
Too low!
10
Too high!
9
Correct!</pre>
</div>
