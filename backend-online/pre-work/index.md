# Back-End Try Coding: Pre-work

<a href="../">Back to Curriculum Index</a>

## Introduction

- why we have you do pre-work
Most participants share that this work took them between 30-60 minutes to complete.

## repl.it

Why we use repl/quick overview of what it is, prompt to watch video

- video of how to use repl
- prompt to create an account of their own

## Intro to Ruby

Ruby is a Back-End programming language. It was written with a focus on simplicity and productivity, so is a great language for beginners!

Programming languages need a way to classify the various types of data they work with. Ruby works with the 3 data types defined below:

<section class="data-type-cards">
  <div class="try-it-new">
    <h3>String</h3>
    <p>A String is a series of characters (alpha, numeric, or symbol) between quotation marks.</p>
    <pre>"Hello, World!"
"12345"</pre>
  </div>

  <div class="try-it-new">
    <h3>Integer</h3>
    <p>An Integer is a number without decimals. Basic math operations can be performed on them.</p>
    <pre>137
3 + 7</pre>
  </div>

  <div class="try-it-new">
    <h3>Boolean</h3>
    <p>A Boolean refers to a value that is either true or false. You can think of it as an on/off switch.</p>
    <pre>true
false</pre>
  </div>
</section>

Ruby provides a command that allows us to print out the data we are working with the the console. It's a tool for learning and troubleshooting, but isn't usually included in the final code of an app. See the following example:

puts "Hello, World!"
puts 5 *  8

<div class="try-it-new">
  <h3>You Try</h3>
  <p>Create a file in your repl account, and "puts" several values out to the console. Run the file and observe the output.</p>
  <p>Now, instead of using the <code class="try-it-code">puts</code> command, use <code class="try-it-code">print</code>. Observe the difference in the output.</p>
  <div class="help-container">
    <button class="help-click">FAQ: Is puts or print preferred?</button>
    <div class="help-toggle">
      <p>Since puts and print are both for learning and troubleshooting, you should use the one your prefer! You may choose one over the other in different situations. There is no "best practice", but it's good to know that both exist.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

- Variables
- Snake case
- Re-assigning variables
- String Interpolation

YOU TRY: Declare 3 variables, interpolate them into one sentence

## Submission

- directions
- google form - share the repl you made for the activities above. a couple questions on where to type your code, see the output, and select all for snake_case
