# HTML (The Bones)

## Tour the Existing HTML

Take a few minutes to explore the HTML code in the CodePen. Do not worry about the CSS or JavaScript yet!

Here are some guiding questions:
- What line numbers in the HTML file are responsible for the text displayed in the browser?
- There are a lot of <code>section</code> elements! What do you think each of them represents?
- What do you think the difference between a `h1` and a `p` element is?
- What might be the purpose of the `class` that appears on some of the elements?
- Anything else you notice?

## Modify the HTML

Let's make some changes to this HTML code. Be sure to click `Run` after each edit to see the changes!
- Change the title of the page to include your name (i.e. "Kat's Magic Eight Ball!")
- Change the default response on the dice so it says something other than "Yes."
- Add an `h2` element on line 3 (under the `h1` and above the `main`) with a sub-heading for the app (i.e. "Click the ball to reveal the answers you're looking for!")

## HTML Summary

- Elements that live inside of the `body` tags will be displayed on the page.
- We can nest elements inside of other elements to create structure within the HTML.
- Classes allow us to give each element a specific label so that we can reference that element later.
- The HTML determines the content of our page!
