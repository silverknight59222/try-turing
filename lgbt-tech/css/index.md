# CSS (The Style)

CSS allows us to "dress up" the content on our page.

## Tour the Existing CSS

Take a few minutes to explore the CSS code in the CodePen. Do not worry about the JavaScript yet!

Here are some guiding questions:
- How do we indicate which HTML element we'd like to apply the styling to?
- What are some properties you see that make sense to you? (i.e. `width`)
- What are some properties you see that do NOT make sense to you? (i.e. `border-radius`)
- What do you think `px` means?

## Modify the CSS

Let's make some changes to this CSS code. Be sure to click `Run` after each edit to see the changes!
- Change the color of the `h1` to: `color: rebeccapurple` (line 3)
- Change the font of the `h2` to: `font-family: cursive` (line 7)
- Change any of the colors or fonts you'd like to! **Only make changes to lines 1-17.**

Note: Use <a target="blank" href="https://htmlcolorcodes.com/color-names/">this list</a> to find more colors! You will notice that we can use both a hex code or a color name as values for color properties. 


## CSS Summary

- CSS allows us to target an element and write specific rules for it to follow.
- Based on the type of rule, CSS will expect different values (ex: `darkgreen` or a hex code for a color and `10px` or `50%` for a measurement).
- There are many types of rules we can write; with practice, we become familiar with more but don't need to memorize them all.
