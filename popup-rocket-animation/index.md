# Pop Up: Animate a Rocket with CSS

In this live, instructor-led workshop, you will customize a drawing of a rocket and program it to fly across the page! You'll leave with your animated rocket on a website that you can share with anyone around the world ðŸš€

_This will be best experienced on a desktop or laptop computer._

## Welcome!

We are so glad you are here! To get set up...
1. Open up <a target="blank" href="http://repl.it/">repl.it</a> in a browser (preferably Chrome) and create a free account
1. Please change your zoom name to first, last initial, pronouns (ex: _Amy H. (she/her)_)
1. Introduce yourself in the zoom chat - where are you calling in from?
<br><br>

## Goals

- Customize a CSS drawing of a rocket and sky scene
- Create a basic animation of the rocket taking off
- Gain _exposure_ to what is possible with CSS
- Determine if coding is something you enjoy doing and want to pursue further

Disclaimer: We won't become experts in CSS today. And you may leave with more questions than answers!

## Programming Languages We Will Use

Building the user-facing part of a website or app is referred to as Front-End Engineering. Building a Front-End requires the writing code in three programming languages, and making the code in each language "talk to" the code in the others. Today, we will get some exposure to _two_ of those languages.

Let's start by building an understanding of what each language is responsible for. We will make some comparisons to the human body to create context.

<section class="data-type-cards language-cards">
  <div>
    <h3>HTML</h3>
    <p>HTML holds the content we see on a page (text, images, etc.) and defines the structure and order in which the content appears.</p>
    <p>We can think of HTML as the skeleton of our webpage; without it, we'd just be a blob:</p>
    <img src="./assets/html.png" alt="Drawing of human skeleton" />
  </div>

  <div>
    <h3>CSS</h3>
    <p>CSS defines the look and feel of a webpage - it can change the layout of items on a page, colors, fonts, and you guessed it - animate items!</p>
    <p>We can think of CSS as anything that makes us unique and recognizable - our skin, hair, clothes, style, etc.</p>
    <img src="./assets/css.png" alt="Drawing of clothes and accessories" />
  </div>
</section>

## Project Setup

We will work off of a starter kit that has already been created. Click [this link to access the starter kit](https://repl.it/@turingschool/rocket-animation-starter#index.html) in repl.it. Here's how to get set up:
1. Once you are on the site, substitute your name in for the `NAME` placeholder on line 4 of the HTML file.
1. Click the green "Run" button at the top of the page, and you should see a scene with a rocket and moon on the right side of the page.

Let's quickly explore the HTML file to understand the "bones" of this app.
