# Wrap Up

One final step... let's make sure everyone can find the link to share your animation with the world.

You can find the live URL above the "mini browser". Copy and paste the link, or click the button in the far-right to open it in a new tab. Have fun <span role="img" aria-label="rocket emoji">ðŸš€</span>

## Next Steps

Are you in love with coding? [Set up a time to meet with Chelsea](https://go.oncehub.com/ChelseaTuring) about what that could look like for you at Turing _or_ send her an email at **chelsea.edu**.

Want to do a little more exploration before taking the next step toward a career change? Here are some great places to start:
- Attend a Try Coding Weekend workshop where you'll go a bit more in depth as to how things work in a given language, and explore the difference between Front-End and Back-End Engineering
- Get more exposure and gain comfort with the syntax by working through one of [Codecademy's free tutorials](https://www.codecademy.com/)
