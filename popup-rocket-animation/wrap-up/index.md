You can find the live URL above the "mini browser". Copy and paste the link, or click the button in the far-right to open it in a new tab. Have fun <span role="img" aria-label="rocket emoji">ðŸš€</span>

## Next Steps

Are you in love with coding? [Set up a time to meet with Launa](https://go.oncehub.com/LaunaGardner1) about what that could look like for you at Turing _or_ send her an email at **launa@turing.edu**.

Want to do a little more exploration before taking the next step toward a career change? Here are some great places to start:
- Attend a Try Coding Weekend workshop where you'll go a bit more in depth as to how things work in a given language, and explore the difference between Front End and Back End Engineering
- Get more exposure and gain comfort with the syntax by working through one of [Codecademy's free tutorials](https://www.codecademy.com/)
