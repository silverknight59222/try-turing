title: Welcome to Try Turing!
---

<p>
  Are you interested in learning how to code, but not sure if a seven-month developer training program is right for you? Do you want to get a feel for what it's like to be a Turing student?​
</p>

<p>
  Try Turing is a two-day program that will expose you to what it's like to be a student at the <a href="http://turing.io">Turing School of Software & Design</a>. During each day, we'll introduce you to one of our two programs.
</p>

<p>
  During the first day, you'll learn the basics of Ruby—a popular programming language for building web applications and writing back-end code. We'll cover how to navigate around your computer using the terminal, read and write files, and write your own command line applications. By the end of the day, you'll have built your very own program to post tweets and read timelines from Twitter.
</p>

<p>
  On the second day, you'll learn the basics of front-end engineering. We'll cover HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. You'll learn how to create, style, and add interactivity to web pages. By the end of the day, you'll build a game from scratch that runs in the browser.
</p>

<p>
  Over the course of the weekend, you'll engage in many of the same activities that our students do during the week. You'll work with a pair. You'll have an opportunity to show off work that you're proud of. You'll receive helpful feedback on how to improve your code from our instructors and TAs. We'll even have a Q&A panel with current students and alumni so you can ask any and all questions that you have about the program.
</p>

<p>
  If you complete the two-day course, you'll be welcome to skip the <a href="http://apply.turing.io">application</a> and move immediately to the interview component of the admissions process. You'll also receive $500 off the cost of your tuition if you're accepted.
