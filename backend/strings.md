      <h2 class="section-header">What is a string?</h2>
      <p>In programming, a <span class="vocab">String</span> is a series of characters (alpha, numeric, or symbol) between quotation marks. This is true in any programming language, not just Ruby.</p> 
    	<p>In the example below, you'll see three separate strings, each surrounded by quotation marks.</p>

      <h2 class="section-header">Our First Program</h2>
      <p>Let's write a program where we we print strings. In the example below, we're using the <code>print</code> method. You can think of a <span class="vocab">method</span> as being synonymous to a command. In this case, we're commanding the computer to print something.</p> 
      <ol>
      	<li>Open the repl below by clicking <b>open in repl.it</b>.</li>
      	<li>Click the <b>Fork</b> button. This will make a copy of the code for your own account.</li>
      	<li>Push the run button to see what happens!</li>

      <h2 class="section-header">Variables and Variable Assignment</h2>
      <p>In middle school math class, you might have learned that variables are single letters that represent numeric values.</p>
      <p>In programming, we can expand that definition: Variables can either be single letters <b>or</b> full words or phrases. In addition, they can represent either numeric data or other types of data (like strings).</p>
      <p>The following screenshot shows four different variables. The numbers at the beginning of the line are <b>not</b> part of the code; they just represent the line number.</p>
      <img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/images/variables.png" alt="Variable definitions">
      <p>Always use lowercase letters in your variable names. If you need to use a space, put an underscore (<code>_</code>) character instead of the space.</p>
      <p>If it helps, you can think of a variable as a labeled box, and inside that box is some piece of data (a number, string, etc.)</p>
      <h3>Sidenote</h3>
      <p>Most text editors have built-in color schemes to help developers recognize different data types and where mistakes might be. For example, if a developer left off a closing quotation mark, the coloring for the rest of the program would be off.</p>
      <h3>Using Variables</h3>
      <p>Once you've defined variables, you can use them like this:</p>
      <iframe height="400px" width="100%" src="https://repl.it/@turingtrycoding/printingvariables?lite=true" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" allowtransparency="true" allowfullscreen="true" sandbox="allow-forms allow-pointer-lock allow-popups allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-modals"></iframe>
      <p>Even better, we can use <span class="vocab">string interpolation</span> to combine static data with dynamic (or variable) data:</p>
      <iframe height="400px" width="100%" src="https://repl.it/@turingtrycoding/stringinterpolation?lite=true" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" allowtransparency="true" allowfullscreen="true" sandbox="allow-forms allow-pointer-lock allow-popups allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-modals"></iframe>

				<h2>Try it: Interpolating Strings</h2>
				<p>Back on repl.it, create a new repl by clicking the <img style="height: 1.5em" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/images/newrepl.png" alt="New Repl button"> button near the top right corner. Choose the Ruby programming language, and name the repl <code>interpolatingstrings</code>. </p>
				<p>Write a program that creates three variables with string values: <code>pet_name</code>, <code>food</code>, and <code>toy</code>. Interpolate those variables into a string to output something like this:</p>
				<pre>Fluffy plays with stuffed mice after eating tuna fish.</pre>
				<p>Need help? The structure of the example above is almost identical to what you'll need for this program!</p>
				<p>Run your program a few times with different values for each variable to make sure it works. When you're done, paste your code in the etherpad.</p>
				<div class="spicy">
					<h4 class="spicy-click">ðŸŒ¶ Spicy Challenge ðŸŒ¶ <small>(click!)</small></h4>
					<div class="spicy-appear">
						<p>Ignoring the rest of your code, for a minute try puts-ing <code>pet_name[0]</code>. What happens? Can you update your code so that it just prints the <b>first two letters</b> of each string?</p>

      <h2 class="section-header">String Methods</h2>
      <p>Earlier, we said that a <span class="vocab">method</span> is a command that we're giving the computer.</p>
      <p>There are also methods that are specific to one data type. Imagine this real-world scenario: a (well-trained) dog can react to the command <code>sit</code>, <code>bark</code>, <code>roll_over</code>, <code>shake</code>, etc. In code, we might right these like this:</p>
      <pre><code>dog.sit</code>

<code>dog.bark</code>

<code>dog.roll_over</code>

<code>dog.shake</code></pre>
			<p>We would call these <b>Dog methods</b> since they are specific to a dog. You wouldn't tell a human "roll over!" or "bark!"</p>
			<p>Just like we have dog-specific methods, we also have string-specific methods.</p>

				<h2>Try it: Reading Code and Predicting Method Outputs</h2>
				<ol>
					<li>Look at (<b>but don't run!</b>) the embedded repl below. With the person next to you, predict what the output will be for each line of code, starting at line 4 and ending at line 10.</li>

					<li>Once you've made your predictions, run the code and look at the output. With the person next to you, review your original guesses and correct anything you wrongly predicted.</li>
