# Extensions

Applying the same concepts, work to implement one final feature.

<div class="try-it-new">
  <h2>Final Feature</h2>
  <p>When the user clicks a "Start Over" button, a new number should be created and the feedback should be hidden or cleared out.</p>
  <p>We won't give you any hints for this one; but if you are stuck or just wanting to check your solution, [you can find one in this Replit](https://replit.com/@turingschool/js-number-guesser-extension#script.js). Keep in mind that it's very possible two developers write different solutions, but both work. There isn't a right or wrong, as long as it gets the job done!</p>
</div>



<div class="try-it-new">
  <h2>ðŸŒ¶ Spicy Challenge ðŸŒ¶</h2>
  <p>Can you find a way to give your user only a limited number of guesses? Hint: You'll need another variable to keep track of how many guesses they've already had!</p>
</div>
