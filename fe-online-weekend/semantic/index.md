<a href="../">Back to Curriculum Index</a>

## Goals

- Build an understanding of how our HTML impacts users that use a screen reader
- Learn some alternatives to the `div` element
- Start learning about WAI-ARIA

## Screen Readers

- Show video clip of someone going through a semantic page vs a not.
- List a couple of the popular ones, how to install and simulate

## Headings

- make sure we use h1 - h6 correctly

## Containers

- alternatives to `div`

TRY IT: Refactor your app - change any divs that make sense to be something else, to that something else.

## WAI-ARIA

- what is it? Docs?
- Roles for labels and inputs
- landmarks??

TRY IT: Add a role to your label and input and check Lighthouse.
