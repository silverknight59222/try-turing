## Goals

## Nesting & Wrapping

- explain the concept of nesting, reference lists from earlier

## Containers

- div

TRY IT: Group three of your current elements in a div, the rest in another div. Add a border or background color so you can see it.

## Cleaning Up Code

- sometimes we write code out as our brain thinks it, and we need to clean up what's left behind.
- different conventions for different languages, teams, etc. Consistency is key.

TRY IT: Clean up this file!
