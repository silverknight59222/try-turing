## Nesting & Wrapping

### Lists

Lists are common on webpages. From bulleted items, to navigation menus with horizontal lists, to a list of followers - they are everywhere! Today, we will focus on numbered and bulleted lists.

TRY IT:

## Containers

- div

TRY IT: Group three of your current elements in a div, the rest in another div. Add a border or background color so you can see it.

## Cleaning Up Code

- sometimes we write code out as our brain thinks it, and we need to clean up what's left behind.
- different conventions for different languages, teams, etc. Consistency is key.

TRY IT: Clean up this file!
