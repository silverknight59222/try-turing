## What is HTML?

Of all of the major technologies used on the web, on either the front- or the back-end, HTML, or Hyper Text Markup Language, is the oldest. In the beginning, the web was just a bunch of HTML documents that you wrote by hand. They had these cool things called hyperlinks that would allow a user to click on a word on one page and be taken to another page.

HTML is still an essential part of modern web applications. It holds the content and creates the structure of a webpage.

## Tags, Content, Elements

HTML is made up of a series of **elements**. Each element is made up of at least one **tag**, and most have **content** between an opening and closing tag. We can think of many elements as containers, which store and organize other elements.
