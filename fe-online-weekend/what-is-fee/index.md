# What is Front-End Engineering?

<a href="../">Back to Curriculum Index</a>

## Goals

- Identify the key differences between Front-End and Back-End engineering
- Categorize various technologies used in Front-End engineering

## What is Front-End?

The **Front-End** is the part of the application that users see, touch, and interact with.

When we're talking about web development, the Front-End is the part of the code base that takes care of rendering the user interface in the web browser.

Over the last decade, the web has evolved from a platform that served static web pages with content to a platform that provides rich, interactive experiences to users.

## What Makes Front-End Engineering Interesting + Challenging?

### It Presents Logical Challenges

### It Can Guide a User Through a Complicated Task

### Or Help Us Understand a Complicated Subject

Big numbers are difficult to imagine. How can you imagine a billion? Even a thousand things collectively is a challenge. The recent news and precautions around COVID-19 is all a lot to take in and understand. Visualizations like this help people understand the role that social distancing can play in reducing the impact of the virus.

### It Allows You, As a Developer, to Tell a Story

## You Don't Have to Be a Designer

Front-end developers often work with designers, who provide detailed comps like the one above. These comps allow a front-end developer to focus on managing the complicated interactions of the site.

There's a common misconception that the front-end is only about colors, fonts, and having a good eye. However, front-end development is more focused on making data useful, accessible, and interactive. The code we write in JavaScript does a lot of heavy logical lifting.

## No Matter Your Passion, You're Needed in FE

While many people become developers because it can provide a stable career and lifestyle, it can also allow you to contribute towards something you are passionate about! Whether that be problems solving, exposing important data, making the web more accessible or anything in between, front-end developers play an essential role.

<br>
## All Front-End Developers Have a Responsibility

While solving these logical challenges and building interfaces that users can use seamlessly, Front-End developers have a responsibility to make sure **all** users have access to anything the site or application provides. Specifically, users with disabilities, including but not limited to: auditory, cognitive, mobility and visual disabilities.

Unfortunately, accessibility is sometimes considered an "edge case" or a "nice-to-have". Front-End developers who put time and energy into learning about this and bringing to their teams can make a huge impact on making the web more accessible!

<br>
## What technologies are used on the Front-End?

The front-end of the web is based on three major technologies:

1. **HTML**: HyperText Markup Language (HTML) defines the structure and semantics of web pages on the web.
2. **CSS**: Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) sets the look and style of a web page. CSS provides style to the structure provided by HTML.
3. **JavaScript**: JavaScript allows us to define interaction in our pages. What happens when a user clicks on a certain area?

## What are we doing this weekend?

1. Dive into two of the technologies used on the frontend: HTML and CSS
2. Explore tools and best practices to make web applications accessible to all users
