## What is a11y?

`a11y` means `accessibility`. There are 11 characters between the `a` and `y` of the word - this is a commonly used pattern in tech to shorten or abbreviate long words.

Web accessibility is a necessary part of a Front-End developers work. It refers to building sites and applications in a way that people with disabilities can perceive, understand, navigate and interact with the content.

While so much assistive technologies exist and structures are in place to build apps that work well with those technologies, this is still a place where the web as a whole has a lot of room for improvement. Developers who are passionate about this have a real opportunity to make an impact on their company, the broader community and most importantly, users.
