# Tools for Accessibility

<a href="../">Back to Curriculum Index</a>

## Goals

- Learn about some of the tools available to assess accessibility
- Use a tool to assess accessibility real sites/apps

## Tools to Audit Accessibility

There are _many_ tools that exist to help developers check the accessibility of their sites. There probably isn't one tool that does it all, so we need to use a combination of tools, as well as do some manual testing.

Because of our limited time together this weekend, we won't go all in on every corner of this. We will dig into two tools pretty extensively and give an overview of others you can check out on your own after this weekend, if you are interested.

## Lighthouse

Available in your Dev Tools, Lighthouse can run an audit on your site and give you back a score (out of 100) as well as specific issues that are limiting on your site.

Let's run a Lighthouse audit on a few sites and see what we find.

<div class="try-it-new">
  <h3>Try It: Lighthouse</h3>
  <p>Run a Lighthouse audit in the Dev Tools on your site.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>What errors/warnings do you have? Share in the chat.</li>
    <li>Take a few minutes to address those issues in your code. Run the audit again to see if you made the necessary improvements.</li>
  </ol>
</div>
