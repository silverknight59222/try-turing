# Intro to JavaScript

<a href="../">Back to Curriculum Index</a>

## Goals

- Identify Strings and Numbers as JavaScript data types
- Create variables to store Strings and Numbers
- Combine static string data with variables using String interpolation

## What is JavaScript?

JavaScript is a language that allows us to _interact_ with a webpage. We can write JavaScript that can access HTML elements and change their appearance or content based on the way a user interacts with the page.

## Strings and Numbers

In programming, a String is a series of characters (alpha, numeric, or symbol) between quotation marks. We classify strings as a **data type**. This is true in any programming language, not just JavaScript.

```js
'I am a string!'

'string-here~~~~~'

"I can also be in double-quotes!"

"I can hold emojis: ðŸ’¥ðŸ¦„âœ¨, lots of spaces:     , and special characters: $#@%"
```

Another data type in JavaScript is a Number. Just like we interact with numbers on a daily basis and in math class, JavaScript can work with numbers. Here are a couple of operations in use:

```js
4 + 2
//=> 6

7 * 3
//=> 21
```

## console.log()

As we learn about JavaScript today, we will use the `console.log()` method to print the data we are working with out to the console. The console is a tool for developers that allows us to log information as part of our development process.

Here's the syntax in the JavaScript file:

```js
console.log('I am a string!');
console.log(4 + 5);
```

When we run the code above, we will see the associated values print out in the console.

## Variables

In JavaScript, we declare variables using the `var` keyword. This tells JavaScript that we're about to make a new variable, or _declare a variable_.

Variables can store strings (text in between quotation marks), numbers, HTML elements, among many other things! Here are a few examples of JavaScript variables:


```js
var age = 104;
var school = 'Turing School of Software & Design';
var firstName = 'Amy';
```

### Why Variables?

Since JavaScript is in charge of user interactions, we may want to hold onto a piece of information for later use.
- On social media sites, there is usually a `username` or `handle` variable. If you are logged in, the variable will be set to your information. If another user was logged in, for the instance of that session, the variable would be set to that other users information.
- Similarly, if you decide to change the value stored in your `username` variable, that gets updated throughout the entire application!

Variables are at the core of everything we do in programming and this isn't unique to JavaScript.

<div class="try-it-new">
  <h3>Try It: Variables</h3>
  <p>Navigate to your JavaScript file.</p>
  <p>Declare 3 variables, using the names <code>name</code>, <code>email</code>, and <code>numberOfPets</code>. Assign each to an appropriate value.</p>
  <p>Make sure to <code>console.log</code> each variable to verify you've stored it correctly!</p>
  <p>Finished? Declare at least 2 more variables - you choose the name and values!</p>
</div>

## Interpolation

We can use string interpolation to combine static data with dynamic (or variable) data. Here's an example of the syntax:

```js
var firstName = 'Amy';
console.log(`Hello, ${firstName}!`);
```

The code above will make "Hello, Amy!" appear in the console.

Note that _back ticks_ are the characters that surround this combination of the string an `${}` syntax. You can find the back-tick key at the top-left of your keyboard, next to the `1`.

Anything inside the back ticks will be read as a string. But, when the interpreter sees the `${`, it will stop and wait for JavaScript code to read. Typically, we provide a variable name here. When the interpreter read the matching closing bracket - `}` - it goes back to treating characters as part of the string.

<div class="try-it-new">
  <h3>Try It: Interpolation</h3>
  <p>Using interpolation and at least two of the variables you declared in the previous section, write a sentence about yourself! Make sure to print that sentence out to the console.</p>
  <p>Change the value of one of the Strings you interpolated and re-run your code. Is the difference reflected in the output?</p>

  <div class="spicy-container">
    <p class="spicy-click">
      <span role="img" aria-label="spicy pepper">ðŸŒ¶</span>Click here for a Spicy Challenge<span role="img" aria-label="spicy pepper">ðŸŒ¶</span>
    </p>
    <div class="spicy-toggle">
      <p>What happens if you interpolate <code>numberOfPets * 4</code>? What does that tell you about how interpolation works?</p>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
